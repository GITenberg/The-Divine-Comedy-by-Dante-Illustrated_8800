<h2>CANTO XIX</h2>
<br>

<p>It was the hour, when of diurnal heat<br>
No reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon,<br>
O'erpower'd by earth, or planetary sway<br>
Of Saturn; and the geomancer sees<br>
His Greater Fortune up the east ascend,<br>
Where gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone;<br>
When 'fore me in my dream a woman's shape<br>
There came, with lips that stammer'd, eyes aslant,<br>
Distorted feet, hands maim'd, and colour pale.<br>
<br>I look'd upon her; and as sunshine cheers<br>
Limbs numb'd by nightly cold, e'en thus my look<br>
Unloos'd her tongue, next in brief space her form<br>
Decrepit rais'd erect, and faded face<br>
With love's own hue illum'd. Recov'ring speech<br>
She forthwith warbling such a strain began,<br>
That I, how loth soe'er, could scarce have held<br>
Attention from the song. &nbsp;"I," thus she sang,<br>
"I am the Siren, she, whom mariners<br>
On the wide sea are wilder'd when they hear:<br>
Such fulness of delight the list'ner feels.<br>
I from his course Ulysses by my lay<br>
Enchanted drew. &nbsp;Whoe'er frequents me once<br>
Parts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart<br>
Contented knows no void." &nbsp;Or ere her mouth<br>
Was clos'd, to shame her at her side appear'd<br>
A dame of semblance holy. &nbsp;With stern voice<br>
She utter'd; "Say, O Virgil, who is this?"<br>
Which hearing, he approach'd, with eyes still bent<br>
Toward that goodly presence: th' other seiz'd her,<br>
And, her robes tearing, open'd her before,<br>
And show'd the belly to me, whence a smell,<br>
Exhaling loathsome, wak'd me. &nbsp;Round I turn'd<br>
Mine eyes, and thus the teacher: "At the least<br>
Three times my voice hath call'd thee. &nbsp;Rise, begone.<br>
Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass."<br>
<br>I straightway rose. &nbsp;Now day, pour'd down from high,<br>
Fill'd all the circuits of the sacred mount;<br>
And, as we journey'd, on our shoulder smote<br>
The early ray. &nbsp;I follow'd, stooping low<br>
My forehead, as a man, o'ercharg'd with thought,<br>
Who bends him to the likeness of an arch,<br>
That midway spans the flood; when thus I heard,<br>
"Come, enter here," in tone so soft and mild,<br>
As never met the ear on mortal strand.<br>
<br>With swan-like wings dispread and pointing up,<br>
Who thus had spoken marshal'd us along,<br>
Where each side of the solid masonry<br>
The sloping, walls retir'd; then mov'd his plumes,<br>
And fanning us, affirm'd that those, who mourn,<br>
Are blessed, for that comfort shall be theirs.<br>
<br>"What aileth thee, that still thou look'st to earth?"<br>
Began my leader; while th' angelic shape<br>
A little over us his station took.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/19-51.jpg"><img alt="19-51th.jpg (38K)" src="images/19-51th.jpg" height="476" width="436"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>"New vision," I replied, "hath rais'd in me<br>
Surmizings strange and anxious doubts, whereon<br>
My soul intent allows no other thought<br>
Or room or entrance."&mdash;"Hast thou seen," said he,<br>
"That old enchantress, her, whose wiles alone<br>
The spirits o'er us weep for? &nbsp;Hast thou seen<br>
How man may free him of her bonds? &nbsp;Enough.<br>
Let thy heels spurn the earth, and thy rais'd ken<br>
Fix on the lure, which heav'n's eternal King<br>
Whirls in the rolling spheres." &nbsp;As on his feet<br>
The falcon first looks down, then to the sky<br>
Turns, and forth stretches eager for the food,<br>
That woos him thither; so the call I heard,<br>
So onward, far as the dividing rock<br>
Gave way, I journey'd, till the plain was reach'd.<br>
<br>On the fifth circle when I stood at large,<br>
A race appear'd before me, on the ground<br>
All downward lying prone and weeping sore.<br>
"My soul hath cleaved to the dust," I heard<br>
With sighs so deep, they well nigh choak'd the words.<br>
"O ye elect of God, whose penal woes<br>
Both hope and justice mitigate, direct<br>
Tow'rds the steep rising our uncertain way."<br>
<br>"If ye approach secure from this our doom,<br>
Prostration&mdash;and would urge your course with speed,<br>
See that ye still to rightward keep the brink."<br>
<br>So them the bard besought; and such the words,<br>
Beyond us some short space, in answer came.<br>
<br>I noted what remain'd yet hidden from them:<br>
Thence to my liege's eyes mine eyes I bent,<br>
And he, forthwith interpreting their suit,<br>
Beckon'd his glad assent. Free then to act,<br>
As pleas'd me, I drew near, and took my stand<br>
O`er that shade, whose words I late had mark'd.<br>
And, "Spirit!" &nbsp;I said, "in whom repentant tears<br>
Mature that blessed hour, when thou with God<br>
Shalt find acceptance, for a while suspend<br>
For me that mightier care. &nbsp;Say who thou wast,<br>
Why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone,<br>
And if in aught ye wish my service there,<br>
Whence living I am come." &nbsp;He answering spake<br>
"The cause why Heav'n our back toward his cope<br>
Reverses, shalt thou know: but me know first<br>
The successor of Peter, and the name<br>
And title of my lineage from that stream,<br>
That' twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws<br>
His limpid waters through the lowly glen.<br>
A month and little more by proof I learnt,<br>
With what a weight that robe of sov'reignty<br>
Upon his shoulder rests, who from the mire<br>
Would guard it: that each other fardel seems<br>
But feathers in the balance. &nbsp;Late, alas!<br>
Was my conversion: but when I became<br>
Rome's pastor, I discern'd at once the dream<br>
And cozenage of life, saw that the heart<br>
Rested not there, and yet no prouder height<br>
Lur'd on the climber: wherefore, of that life<br>
No more enamour'd, in my bosom love<br>
Of purer being kindled. &nbsp;For till then<br>
I was a soul in misery, alienate<br>
From God, and covetous of all earthly things;<br>
Now, as thou seest, here punish'd for my doting.<br>
Such cleansing from the taint of avarice<br>
Do spirits converted need. &nbsp;This mount inflicts<br>
No direr penalty. &nbsp;E'en as our eyes<br>
Fasten'd below, nor e'er to loftier clime<br>
Were lifted, thus hath justice level'd us<br>
Here on the earth. &nbsp;As avarice quench'd our love<br>
Of good, without which is no working, thus<br>
Here justice holds us prison'd, hand and foot<br>
Chain'd down and bound, while heaven's just Lord shall please.<br>
So long to tarry motionless outstretch'd."<br>
<br>My knees I stoop'd, and would have spoke; but he,<br>
Ere my beginning, by his ear perceiv'd<br>
I did him reverence; and "What cause," said he,<br>
"Hath bow'd thee thus!"&mdash;"Compunction," I rejoin'd.<br>
"And inward awe of your high dignity."<br>


<br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>


<br>"Up," he exclaim'd, "brother! upon thy feet<br>
Arise: err not: thy fellow servant I,<br>
(Thine and all others') of one Sovran Power.<br>
If thou hast ever mark'd those holy sounds<br>
Of gospel truth, 'nor shall be given ill marriage,'<br>
Thou mayst discern the reasons of my speech.<br>
Go thy ways now; and linger here no more.<br>
Thy tarrying is a let unto the tears,<br>
With which I hasten that whereof thou spak'st.<br>
I have on earth a kinswoman; her name<br>
Alagia, worthy in herself, so ill<br>
Example of our house corrupt her not:<br>
And she is all remaineth of me there."</p>

<h2>CANTO XX</h2>
<br>

<p>Ill strives the will, 'gainst will more wise that strives<br>
His pleasure therefore to mine own preferr'd,<br>
I drew the sponge yet thirsty from the wave.<br>
<br>Onward I mov'd: he also onward mov'd,<br>
Who led me, coasting still, wherever place<br>
Along the rock was vacant, as a man<br>
Walks near the battlements on narrow wall.<br>
For those on th' other part, who drop by drop<br>
Wring out their all-infecting malady,<br>
Too closely press the verge. &nbsp;Accurst be thou!<br>
Inveterate wolf! whose gorge ingluts more prey,<br>
Than every beast beside, yet is not fill'd!<br>
So bottomless thy maw!&mdash;Ye spheres of heaven!<br>
To whom there are, as seems, who attribute<br>
All change in mortal state, when is the day<br>
Of his appearing, for whom fate reserves<br>
To chase her hence? &nbsp;&mdash;With wary steps and slow<br>
We pass'd; and I attentive to the shades,<br>
Whom piteously I heard lament and wail;<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/20-17.jpg"><img alt="20-17th.jpg (38K)" src="images/20-17th.jpg" height="477" width="440"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


And, 'midst the wailing, one before us heard<br>
Cry out "O blessed Virgin!" &nbsp;as a dame<br>
In the sharp pangs of childbed; and "How poor<br>
Thou wast," it added, "witness that low roof<br>
Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.<br>
O good Fabricius! thou didst virtue choose<br>
With poverty, before great wealth with vice."<br>
<br>The words so pleas'd me, that desire to know<br>
The spirit, from whose lip they seem'd to come,<br>
Did draw me onward. &nbsp;Yet it spake the gift<br>
Of Nicholas, which on the maidens he<br>
Bounteous bestow'd, to save their youthful prime<br>
Unblemish'd. &nbsp;"Spirit! who dost speak of deeds<br>
So worthy, tell me who thou was," I said,<br>
"And why thou dost with single voice renew<br>
Memorial of such praise. That boon vouchsaf'd<br>
Haply shall meet reward; if I return<br>
To finish the Short pilgrimage of life,<br>
Still speeding to its close on restless wing."<br>
<br>"I," answer'd he, "will tell thee, not for hell,<br>
Which thence I look for; but that in thyself<br>
Grace so exceeding shines, before thy time<br>
Of mortal dissolution. &nbsp;I was root<br>
Of that ill plant, whose shade such poison sheds<br>
O'er all the Christian land, that seldom thence<br>
Good fruit is gather'd. &nbsp;Vengeance soon should come,<br>
Had Ghent and Douay, Lille and Bruges power;<br>
And vengeance I of heav'n's great Judge implore.<br>
Hugh Capet was I high: from me descend<br>
The Philips and the Louis, of whom France<br>
Newly is govern'd; born of one, who ply'd<br>
The slaughterer's trade at Paris. &nbsp;When the race<br>
Of ancient kings had vanish'd (all save one<br>
Wrapt up in sable weeds) within my gripe<br>
I found the reins of empire, and such powers<br>
Of new acquirement, with full store of friends,<br>
That soon the widow'd circlet of the crown<br>
Was girt upon the temples of my son,<br>
He, from whose bones th' anointed race begins.<br>
Till the great dower of Provence had remov'd<br>
The stains, that yet obscur'd our lowly blood,<br>
Its sway indeed was narrow, but howe'er<br>
It wrought no evil: there, with force and lies,<br>
Began its rapine; after, for amends,<br>
Poitou it seiz'd, Navarre and Gascony.<br>
To Italy came Charles, and for amends<br>
Young Conradine an innocent victim slew,<br>
And sent th' angelic teacher back to heav'n,<br>
Still for amends. &nbsp;I see the time at hand,<br>
That forth from France invites another Charles<br>
To make himself and kindred better known.<br>
Unarm'd he issues, saving with that lance,<br>
Which the arch-traitor tilted with; and that<br>
He carries with so home a thrust, as rives<br>
The bowels of poor Florence. &nbsp;No increase<br>
Of territory hence, but sin and shame<br>
Shall be his guerdon, and so much the more<br>
As he more lightly deems of such foul wrong.<br>
I see the other, who a prisoner late<br>
Had steps on shore, exposing to the mart<br>
His daughter, whom he bargains for, as do<br>
The Corsairs for their slaves. &nbsp;O avarice!<br>
What canst thou more, who hast subdued our blood<br>
So wholly to thyself, they feel no care<br>
Of their own flesh? &nbsp;To hide with direr guilt<br>
Past ill and future, &nbsp;lo!  the flower-de-luce<br>
Enters Alagna! in his Vicar Christ<br>
Himself a captive, and his mockery<br>
Acted again! Lo! lo his holy lip<br>
The vinegar and gall once more applied!<br>
And he 'twixt living robbers doom'd to bleed!<br>
Lo! the new Pilate, of whose cruelty<br>
Such violence cannot fill the measure up,<br>
With no degree to sanction, pushes on<br>
Into the temple his yet eager sails!<br>
<br>"O sovran Master! when shall I rejoice<br>
To see the vengeance, which thy wrath well-pleas'd<br>
In secret silence broods?&mdash;While daylight lasts,<br>
So long what thou didst hear of her, sole spouse<br>
Of the Great Spirit, and on which thou turn'dst<br>
To me for comment, is the general theme<br>
Of all our prayers: but when it darkens, then<br>
A different strain we utter, then record<br>
Pygmalion, whom his gluttonous thirst of gold<br>
Made traitor, robber, parricide: the woes<br>
Of Midas, which his greedy wish ensued,<br>
Mark'd for derision to all future times:<br>
And the fond Achan, how he stole the prey,<br>
That yet he seems by Joshua's ire pursued.<br>
Sapphira with her husband next, we blame;<br>
And praise the forefeet, that with furious ramp<br>
Spurn'd Heliodorus. &nbsp;All the mountain round<br>
Rings with the infamy of Thracia's king,<br>
Who slew his Phrygian charge: and last a shout<br>
Ascends: "Declare, O Crassus! for thou know'st,<br>
The flavour of thy gold." &nbsp;The voice of each<br>
Now high now low, as each his impulse prompts,<br>
Is led through many a pitch, acute or grave.<br>
Therefore, not singly, I erewhile rehears'd<br>
That blessedness we tell of in the day:<br>
But near me none beside his accent rais'd."<br>
<br>From him we now had parted, and essay'd<br>
With utmost efforts to surmount the way,<br>
When I did feel, as nodding to its fall,<br>
The mountain tremble; whence an icy chill<br>
Seiz'd on me, as on one to death convey'd.<br>
So shook not Delos, when Latona there<br>
Couch'd to bring forth the twin-born eyes of heaven.<br>
<br>Forthwith from every side a shout arose<br>
So vehement, that suddenly my guide<br>
Drew near, and cried: "Doubt not, while I conduct thee."<br>
"Glory!" all shouted (such the sounds mine ear<br>
Gather'd from those, who near me swell'd the sounds)<br>
"Glory in the highest be to God." &nbsp;We stood<br>
Immovably suspended, like to those,<br>
The shepherds, who first heard in Bethlehem's field<br>
That song: till ceas'd the trembling, and the song<br>
Was ended: then our hallow'd path resum'd,<br>
Eying the prostrate shadows, who renew'd<br>
Their custom'd mourning. &nbsp;Never in my breast<br>
Did ignorance so struggle with desire<br>
Of knowledge, if my memory do not err,<br>
As in that moment; nor through haste dar'd I<br>
To question, nor myself could aught discern,<br>
So on I far'd in thoughtfulness and dread.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="21"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXI</h2>
<br>

<p>The natural thirst, ne'er quench'd but from the well,<br>
Whereof the woman of Samaria crav'd,<br>
Excited: haste along the cumber'd path,<br>
After my guide, impell'd; and pity mov'd<br>
My bosom for the 'vengeful deed, though just.<br>
When lo! even as Luke relates, that Christ<br>
Appear'd unto the two upon their way,<br>
New-risen from his vaulted grave; to us<br>
A shade appear'd, and after us approach'd,<br>
Contemplating the crowd beneath its feet.<br>
We were not ware of it; so first it spake,<br>
Saying, "God give you peace, my brethren!" then<br>
Sudden we turn'd: and Virgil such salute,<br>
As fitted that kind greeting, gave, and cried:<br>
"Peace in the blessed council be thy lot<br>
Awarded by that righteous court, which me<br>
To everlasting banishment exiles!"<br>
<br>"How!" he exclaim'd, nor from his speed meanwhile<br>
Desisting, "If that ye be spirits, whom God<br>
Vouchsafes not room above, who up the height<br>
Has been thus far your guide?" &nbsp;To whom the bard:<br>
"If thou observe the tokens, which this man<br>
Trac'd by the finger of the angel bears,<br>
'Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just<br>
He needs must share. &nbsp;But sithence she, whose wheel<br>
Spins day and night, for him not yet had drawn<br>
That yarn, which, on the fatal distaff pil'd,<br>
Clotho apportions to each wight that breathes,<br>
His soul, that sister is to mine and thine,<br>
Not of herself could mount, for not like ours<br>
Her ken: whence I, from forth the ample gulf<br>
Of hell was ta'en, to lead him, and will lead<br>
Far as my lore avails. &nbsp;But, if thou know,<br>
Instruct us for what cause, the mount erewhile<br>
Thus shook and trembled: wherefore all at once<br>
Seem'd shouting, even from his wave-wash'd foot."<br>
<br>That questioning so tallied with my wish,<br>
The thirst did feel abatement of its edge<br>
E'en from expectance. &nbsp;He forthwith replied,<br>
"In its devotion nought irregular<br>
This mount can witness, or by punctual rule<br>
Unsanction'd; here from every change exempt.<br>
Other than that, which heaven in itself<br>
Doth of itself receive, no influence<br>
Can reach us. &nbsp;Tempest none, shower, hail or snow,<br>
Hoar frost or dewy moistness, higher falls<br>
Than that brief scale of threefold steps: thick clouds<br>
Nor scudding rack are ever seen: swift glance<br>
Ne'er lightens, nor Thaumantian Iris gleams,<br>
That yonder often shift on each side heav'n.<br>
Vapour adust doth never mount above<br>
The highest of the trinal stairs, whereon<br>
Peter's vicegerent stands. &nbsp;Lower perchance,<br>
With various motion rock'd, trembles the soil:<br>
But here, through wind in earth's deep hollow pent,<br>
I know not how, yet never trembled: then<br>
Trembles, when any spirit feels itself<br>
So purified, that it may rise, or move<br>
For rising, and such loud acclaim ensues.<br>
Purification by the will alone<br>
Is prov'd, that free to change society<br>
Seizes the soul rejoicing in her will.<br>
Desire of bliss is present from the first;<br>
But strong propension hinders, to that wish<br>
By the just ordinance of heav'n oppos'd;<br>
Propension now as eager to fulfil<br>
Th' allotted torment, as erewhile to sin.<br>
And I who in this punishment had lain<br>
Five hundred years and more, but now have felt<br>
Free wish for happier clime. &nbsp;Therefore thou felt'st<br>
The mountain tremble, and the spirits devout<br>
Heard'st, over all his limits, utter praise<br>
To that liege Lord, whom I entreat their joy<br>
To hasten." &nbsp;Thus he spake: and since the draught<br>
Is grateful ever as the thirst is keen,<br>
No words may speak my fullness of content.<br>
<br>"Now," said the instructor sage, "I see the net<br>
That takes ye here, and how the toils are loos'd,<br>
Why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice.<br>
Vouchsafe, that from thy lips I next may learn,<br>
Who on the earth thou wast, and wherefore here<br>
So many an age wert prostrate."&mdash;"In that time,<br>
When the good Titus, with Heav'n's King to help,<br>
Aveng'd those piteous gashes, whence the blood<br>
By Judas sold did issue, with the name<br>
Most lasting and most honour'd there was I<br>
Abundantly renown'd," the shade reply'd,<br>
"Not yet with faith endued. &nbsp;So passing sweet<br>
My vocal Spirit, from Tolosa, Rome<br>
To herself drew me, where I merited<br>
A myrtle garland to inwreathe my brow.<br>
Statius they name me still. &nbsp;Of Thebes I sang,<br>
And next of great Achilles: but i' th' way<br>
Fell with the second burthen. &nbsp;Of my flame<br>
Those sparkles were the seeds, which I deriv'd<br>
From the bright fountain of celestial fire<br>
That feeds unnumber'd lamps, the song I mean<br>
Which sounds Aeneas' wand'rings: that the breast<br>
I hung at, that the nurse, from whom my veins<br>
Drank inspiration: whose authority<br>
Was ever sacred with me. &nbsp;To have liv'd<br>
Coeval with the Mantuan, I would bide<br>
The revolution of another sun<br>
Beyond my stated years in banishment."<br>
<br>The Mantuan, when he heard him, turn'd to me,<br>
And holding silence: by his countenance<br>
Enjoin'd me silence but the power which wills,<br>
Bears not supreme control: laughter and tears<br>
Follow so closely on the passion prompts them,<br>
They wait not for the motions of the will<br>
In natures most sincere. &nbsp;I did but smile,<br>
As one who winks; and thereupon the shade<br>
Broke off, and peer'd into mine eyes, where best<br>
Our looks interpret. "So to good event<br>
Mayst thou conduct such great emprize," he cried,<br>
"Say, why across thy visage beam'd, but now,<br>
The lightning of a smile!" &nbsp;On either part<br>
Now am I straiten'd; one conjures me speak,<br>
Th' other to silence binds me: whence a sigh<br>
I utter, and the sigh is heard. &nbsp;"Speak on;"<br>
The teacher cried; "and do not fear to speak,<br>
But tell him what so earnestly he asks."<br>
Whereon I thus: "Perchance, O ancient spirit!<br>
Thou marvel'st at my smiling. There is room<br>
For yet more wonder. &nbsp;He who guides my ken<br>
On high, he is that Mantuan, led by whom<br>
Thou didst presume of men and gods to sing.<br>
If other cause thou deem'dst for which I smil'd,<br>
Leave it as not the true one; and believe<br>
Those words, thou spak'st of him, indeed the cause."<br>
<br>Now down he bent t' embrace my teacher's feet;<br>
But he forbade him: "Brother! do it not:<br>
Thou art a shadow, and behold'st a shade."<br>
He rising answer'd thus: "Now hast thou prov'd<br>
The force and ardour of the love I bear thee,<br>
When I forget we are but things of air,<br>
And as a substance treat an empty shade."</p>

<h2>CANTO XXII</h2>
<br>

<p>Now we had left the angel, who had turn'd<br>
To the sixth circle our ascending step,<br>
One gash from off my forehead raz'd: while they,<br>
Whose wishes tend to justice, shouted forth:<br>
"Blessed!" &nbsp;and ended with, "I thirst:" and I,<br>
More nimble than along the other straits,<br>
So journey'd, that, without the sense of toil,<br>
I follow'd upward the swift-footed shades;<br>
When Virgil thus began: "Let its pure flame<br>
From virtue flow, and love can never fail<br>
To warm another's bosom' so the light<br>
Shine manifestly forth. &nbsp;Hence from that hour,<br>
When 'mongst us in the purlieus of the deep,<br>
Came down the spirit of Aquinum's hard,<br>
Who told of thine affection, my good will<br>
Hath been for thee of quality as strong<br>
As ever link'd itself to one not seen.<br>
Therefore these stairs will now seem short to me.<br>
But tell me: and if too secure I loose<br>
The rein with a friend's license, as a friend<br>
Forgive me, and speak now as with a friend:<br>
How chanc'd it covetous desire could find<br>
Place in that bosom, 'midst such ample store<br>
Of wisdom, as thy zeal had treasur'd there?"<br>
<br>First somewhat mov'd to laughter by his words,<br>
Statius replied: "Each syllable of thine<br>
Is a dear pledge of love. &nbsp;Things oft appear<br>
That minister false matters to our doubts,<br>
When their true causes are remov'd from sight.<br>
Thy question doth assure me, thou believ'st<br>
I was on earth a covetous man, perhaps<br>
Because thou found'st me in that circle plac'd.<br>
Know then I was too wide of avarice:<br>
And e'en for that excess, thousands of moons<br>
Have wax'd and wan'd upon my sufferings.<br>
And were it not that I with heedful care<br>
Noted where thou exclaim'st as if in ire<br>
With human nature, 'Why, thou cursed thirst<br>
Of gold! dost not with juster measure guide<br>
The appetite of mortals?' &nbsp;I had met<br>
The fierce encounter of the voluble rock.<br>
Then was I ware that with too ample wing<br>
The hands may haste to lavishment, and turn'd,<br>
As from my other evil, so from this<br>
In penitence. &nbsp;How many from their grave<br>
Shall with shorn locks arise, who living, aye<br>
And at life's last extreme, of this offence,<br>
Through ignorance, did not repent. &nbsp;And know,<br>
The fault which lies direct from any sin<br>
In level opposition, here With that<br>
Wastes its green rankness on one common heap.<br>
Therefore if I have been with those, who wail<br>
Their avarice, to cleanse me, through reverse<br>
Of their transgression, such hath been my lot."<br>
<br>To whom the sovran of the pastoral song:<br>
"While thou didst sing that cruel warfare wag'd<br>
By the twin sorrow of Jocasta's womb,<br>
From thy discourse with Clio there, it seems<br>
As faith had not been shine: without the which<br>
Good deeds suffice not. &nbsp;And if so, what sun<br>
Rose on thee, or what candle pierc'd the dark<br>
That thou didst after see to hoist the sail,<br>
And follow, where the fisherman had led?"<br>
<br>He answering thus: "By thee conducted first,<br>
I enter'd the Parnassian grots, and quaff'd<br>
Of the clear spring; illumin'd first by thee<br>
Open'd mine eyes to God. &nbsp;Thou didst, as one,<br>
Who, journeying through the darkness, hears a light<br>
Behind, that profits not himself, but makes<br>
His followers wise, when thou exclaimedst, 'Lo!<br>
A renovated world! &nbsp;Justice return'd!<br>
Times of primeval innocence restor'd!<br>
And a new race descended from above!'<br>
Poet and Christian both to thee I owed.<br>
That thou mayst mark more clearly what I trace,<br>
My hand shall stretch forth to inform the lines<br>
With livelier colouring. &nbsp;Soon o'er all the world,<br>
By messengers from heav'n, the true belief<br>
Teem'd now prolific, and that word of thine<br>
Accordant, to the new instructors chim'd.<br>
Induc'd by which agreement, I was wont<br>
Resort to them; and soon their sanctity<br>
So won upon me, that, Domitian's rage<br>
Pursuing them, I mix'd my tears with theirs,<br>
And, while on earth I stay'd, still succour'd them;<br>
And their most righteous customs made me scorn<br>
All sects besides. &nbsp;Before I led the Greeks<br>
In tuneful fiction, to the streams of Thebes,<br>
I was baptiz'd; but secretly, through fear,<br>
Remain'd a Christian, and conform'd long time<br>
To Pagan rites. &nbsp;Five centuries and more,<br>
T for that lukewarmness was fain to pace<br>
Round the fourth circle. &nbsp;Thou then, who hast rais'd<br>
The covering, which did hide such blessing from me,<br>
Whilst much of this ascent is yet to climb,<br>
Say, if thou know, where our old Terence bides,<br>
Caecilius, Plautus, Varro: if condemn'd<br>
They dwell, and in what province of the deep."<br>
"These," said my guide, "with Persius and myself,<br>
And others many more, are with that Greek,<br>
Of mortals, the most cherish'd by the Nine,<br>
In the first ward of darkness. &nbsp;There ofttimes<br>
We of that mount hold converse, on whose top<br>
For aye our nurses live. &nbsp;We have the bard<br>
Of Pella, and the Teian, Agatho,<br>
Simonides, and many a Grecian else<br>
Ingarlanded with laurel. &nbsp;Of thy train<br>
Antigone is there, Deiphile,<br>
Argia, and as sorrowful as erst<br>
Ismene, and who show'd Langia's wave:<br>
Deidamia with her sisters there,<br>
And blind Tiresias' daughter, and the bride<br>
Sea-born of Peleus." &nbsp;Either poet now<br>
Was silent, and no longer by th' ascent<br>
Or the steep walls obstructed, round them cast<br>
Inquiring eyes. &nbsp;Four handmaids of the day<br>
Had finish'd now their office, and the fifth<br>
Was at the chariot-beam, directing still<br>
Its balmy point aloof, when thus my guide:<br>
"Methinks, it well behooves us to the brink<br>
Bend the right shoulder' circuiting the mount,<br>
As we have ever us'd." &nbsp;So custom there<br>
Was usher to the road, the which we chose<br>
Less doubtful, as that worthy shade complied.<br>
<br>They on before me went; I sole pursued,<br>
List'ning their speech, that to my thoughts convey'd<br>
Mysterious lessons of sweet poesy.<br>
But soon they ceas'd; for midway of the road<br>
A tree we found, with goodly fruitage hung,<br>
And pleasant to the smell: and as a fir<br>
Upward from bough to bough less ample spreads,<br>
So downward this less ample spread, that none.<br>
Methinks, aloft may climb. &nbsp;Upon the side,<br>
That clos'd our path, a liquid crystal fell<br>
From the steep rock, and through the sprays above<br>
Stream'd showering. &nbsp;With associate step the bards<br>
Drew near the plant; and from amidst the leaves<br>
A voice was heard: "Ye shall be chary of me;"<br>
And after added: "Mary took more thought<br>
For joy and honour of the nuptial feast,<br>
Than for herself who answers now for you.<br>
The women of old Rome were satisfied<br>
With water for their beverage. &nbsp;Daniel fed<br>
On pulse, and wisdom gain'd. &nbsp;The primal age<br>
Was beautiful as gold; and hunger then<br>
Made acorns tasteful, thirst each rivulet<br>
Run nectar. &nbsp;Honey and locusts were the food,<br>
Whereon the Baptist in the wilderness<br>
Fed, and that eminence of glory reach'd<br>
And greatness, which the' Evangelist records."</p>

<h2>CANTO XXIII</h2>
<br>

<p>On the green leaf mine eyes were fix'd, like his<br>
Who throws away his days in idle chase<br>
Of the diminutive, when thus I heard<br>
The more than father warn me: "Son! our time<br>
Asks thriftier using. &nbsp;Linger not: away."<br>
<br>Thereat my face and steps at once I turn'd<br>
Toward the sages, by whose converse cheer'd<br>
I journey'd on, and felt no toil: and lo!<br>
A sound of weeping and a song: "My lips,<br>
O Lord!" and these so mingled, it gave birth<br>
To pleasure and to pain. &nbsp;"O Sire, belov'd!<br>
Say what is this I hear?" &nbsp;Thus I inquir'd.<br>
<br>"Spirits," said he, "who as they go, perchance,<br>
Their debt of duty pay." &nbsp;As on their road<br>
The thoughtful pilgrims, overtaking some<br>
Not known unto them, turn to them, and look,<br>
But stay not; thus, approaching from behind<br>
With speedier motion, eyed us, as they pass'd,<br>
A crowd of spirits, silent and devout.<br>
The eyes of each were dark and hollow: pale<br>
Their visage, and so lean withal, the bones<br>
Stood staring thro' the skin. &nbsp;I do not think<br>
Thus dry and meagre Erisicthon show'd,<br>
When pinc'ed by sharp-set famine to the quick.<br>
<br>"Lo!" to myself I mus'd, "the race, who lost<br>
Jerusalem, when Mary with dire beak<br>
Prey'd on her child." &nbsp;The sockets seem'd as rings,<br>
From which the gems were drops. &nbsp;Who reads the name<br>
Of man upon his forehead, there the M<br>
Had trac'd most plainly. &nbsp;Who would deem, that scent<br>
Of water and an apple, could have prov'd<br>
Powerful to generate such pining want,<br>
Not knowing how it wrought? &nbsp;While now I stood<br>
Wond'ring what thus could waste them (for the cause<br>
Of their gaunt hollowness and scaly rind<br>
Appear'd not) lo! a spirit turn'd his eyes<br>
In their deep-sunken cell, and fasten'd then<br>
On me, then cried with vehemence aloud:<br>
"What grace is this vouchsaf'd me?" &nbsp;By his looks<br>
I ne'er had recogniz'd him: but the voice<br>
Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal'd.<br>
Remembrance of his alter'd lineaments<br>
Was kindled from that spark; and I agniz'd<br>
The visage of Forese. &nbsp;"Ah! respect<br>
This wan and leprous wither'd skin," thus he<br>
Suppliant implor'd, "this macerated flesh.<br>
Speak to me truly of thyself. &nbsp;And who<br>
Are those twain spirits, that escort thee there?<br>
Be it not said thou Scorn'st to talk with me."<br>

<br><br><br><br>


<br>"That face of thine," I answer'd him, "which dead<br>
I once bewail'd, disposes me not less<br>
For weeping, when I see It thus transform'd.<br>
Say then, by Heav'n, what blasts ye thus? &nbsp;The whilst<br>
I wonder, ask not Speech from me: unapt<br>
Is he to speak, whom other will employs."<br>
<br>He thus: "The water and tee plant we pass'd,<br>
Virtue possesses, by th' eternal will<br>
Infus'd, the which so pines me. &nbsp;Every spirit,<br>
Whose song bewails his gluttony indulg'd<br>
Too grossly, here in hunger and in thirst<br>
Is purified. &nbsp;The odour, which the fruit,<br>
And spray, that showers upon the verdure, breathe,<br>
Inflames us with desire to feed and drink.<br>
Nor once alone encompassing our route<br>
We come to add fresh fuel to the pain:<br>
Pain, said I? &nbsp;solace rather: for that will<br>
To the tree leads us, by which Christ was led<br>
To call Elias, joyful when he paid<br>
Our ransom from his vein." &nbsp;I answering thus:<br>
"Forese! from that day, in which the world<br>
For better life thou changedst, not five years<br>
Have circled. &nbsp;If the power of sinning more<br>
Were first concluded in thee, ere thou knew'st<br>
That kindly grief, which re-espouses us<br>
To God, how hither art thou come so soon?<br>
I thought to find thee lower, there, where time<br>
Is recompense for time." &nbsp;He straight replied:<br>
"To drink up the sweet wormwood of affliction<br>
I have been brought thus early by the tears<br>
Stream'd down my Nella's cheeks. &nbsp;Her prayers devout,<br>
Her sighs have drawn me from the coast, where oft<br>
Expectance lingers, and have set me free<br>
From th' other circles. &nbsp;In the sight of God<br>
So much the dearer is my widow priz'd,<br>
She whom I lov'd so fondly, as she ranks<br>
More singly eminent for virtuous deeds.<br>
The tract most barb'rous of Sardinia's isle,<br>
Hath dames more chaste and modester by far<br>
Than that wherein I left her. &nbsp;O sweet brother!<br>
What wouldst thou have me say? &nbsp;A time to come<br>
Stands full within my view, to which this hour<br>
Shall not be counted of an ancient date,<br>
When from the pulpit shall be loudly warn'd<br>
Th' unblushing dames of Florence, lest they bare<br>
Unkerchief'd bosoms to the common gaze.<br>
What savage women hath the world e'er seen,<br>
What Saracens, for whom there needed scourge<br>
Of spiritual or other discipline,<br>
To force them walk with cov'ring on their limbs!<br>
But did they see, the shameless ones, that Heav'n<br>
Wafts on swift wing toward them, while I speak,<br>
Their mouths were op'd for howling: they shall taste<br>
Of Borrow (unless foresight cheat me here)<br>
Or ere the cheek of him be cloth'd with down<br>
Who is now rock'd with lullaby asleep.<br>
Ah! now, my brother, hide thyself no more,<br>
Thou seest how not I alone but all<br>
Gaze, where thou veil'st the intercepted sun."<br>
<br>Whence I replied: "If thou recall to mind<br>
What we were once together, even yet<br>
Remembrance of those days may grieve thee sore.<br>
That I forsook that life, was due to him<br>
Who there precedes me, some few evenings past,<br>
When she was round, who shines with sister lamp<br>
To his, that glisters yonder," and I show'd<br>
The sun. &nbsp;"Tis he, who through profoundest night<br>
Of he true dead has brought me, with this flesh<br>
As true, that follows. &nbsp;From that gloom the aid<br>
Of his sure comfort drew me on to climb,<br>
And climbing wind along this mountain-steep,<br>
Which rectifies in you whate'er the world<br>
Made crooked and deprav'd I have his word,<br>
That he will bear me company as far<br>
As till I come where Beatrice dwells:<br>
But there must leave me. &nbsp;Virgil is that spirit,<br>
Who thus hath promis'd," &nbsp;and I pointed to him;<br>
"The other is that shade, for whom so late<br>
Your realm, as he arose, exulting shook<br>
Through every pendent cliff and rocky bound."</p>

<h2>CANTO XXIV</h2>
<br>

<p>Our journey was not slacken'd by our talk,<br>
Nor yet our talk by journeying. &nbsp;Still we spake,<br>
And urg'd our travel stoutly, like a ship<br>
When the wind sits astern. &nbsp;The shadowy forms,<br>


<br><br><br><br>

That seem'd things dead and dead again, drew in<br>
At their deep-delved orbs rare wonder of me,<br>
Perceiving I had life; and I my words<br>
Continued, and thus spake; "He journeys up<br>
Perhaps more tardily then else he would,<br>
For others' sake. &nbsp;But tell me, if thou know'st,<br>
Where is Piccarda? &nbsp;Tell me, if I see<br>
Any of mark, among this multitude,<br>
Who eye me thus."&mdash;"My sister (she for whom,<br>
'Twixt beautiful and good I cannot say<br>
Which name was fitter ) wears e'en now her crown,<br>
And triumphs in Olympus." &nbsp;Saying this,<br>
He added: "Since spare diet hath so worn<br>
Our semblance out, 't is lawful here to name<br>
Each one. &nbsp;This," and his finger then he rais'd,<br>
"Is Buonaggiuna,&mdash;Buonaggiuna, he<br>
Of Lucca: and that face beyond him, pierc'd<br>
Unto a leaner fineness than the rest,<br>
Had keeping of the church: he was of Tours,<br>
And purges by wan abstinence away<br>
Bolsena's eels and cups of muscadel."<br>
<br>He show'd me many others, one by one,<br>
And all, as they were nam'd, seem'd well content;<br>
For no dark gesture I discern'd in any.<br>
I saw through hunger Ubaldino grind<br>
His teeth on emptiness; and Boniface,<br>
That wav'd the crozier o'er a num'rous flock.<br>
I saw the Marquis, who tad time erewhile<br>
To swill at Forli with less drought, yet so<br>
Was one ne'er sated. &nbsp;I howe'er, like him,<br>
That gazing 'midst a crowd, singles out one,<br>
So singled him of Lucca; for methought<br>
Was none amongst them took such note of me.<br>
Somewhat I heard him whisper of Gentucca:<br>
The sound was indistinct, and murmur'd there,<br>
Where justice, that so strips them, fix'd her sting.<br>
<br>"Spirit!" said I, "it seems as thou wouldst fain<br>
Speak with me. &nbsp;Let me hear thee. &nbsp;Mutual wish<br>
To converse prompts, which let us both indulge."<br>
<br>He, answ'ring, straight began: "Woman is born,<br>
Whose brow no wimple shades yet, that shall make<br>
My city please thee, blame it as they may.<br>
Go then with this forewarning. &nbsp;If aught false<br>
My whisper too implied, th' event shall tell<br>
But say, if of a &nbsp;truth I see the man<br>
Of that new lay th' inventor, which begins<br>
With 'Ladies, ye that con the lore of love'."<br>
<br>To whom I thus: "Count of me but as one<br>
Who am the scribe of love; that, when he breathes,<br>
Take up my pen, and, as he dictates, write."<br>
<br>"Brother!" said he, "the hind'rance which once held<br>
The notary with Guittone and myself,<br>
Short of that new and sweeter style I hear,<br>
Is now disclos'd. &nbsp;I see how ye your plumes<br>
Stretch, as th' inditer guides them; which, no question,<br>
Ours did not. &nbsp;He that seeks a grace beyond,<br>
Sees not the distance parts one style from other."<br>
And, as contented, here he held his peace.<br>
<br>Like as the bird, that winter near the Nile,<br>
In squared regiment direct their course,<br>
Then stretch themselves in file for speedier flight;<br>
Thus all the tribe of spirits, as they turn'd<br>
Their visage, faster deaf, nimble alike<br>
Through leanness and desire. &nbsp;And as a man,<br>
Tir'd With the motion of a trotting steed,<br>
Slacks pace, and stays behind his company,<br>
Till his o'erbreathed lungs keep temperate time;<br>
E'en so Forese let that holy crew<br>
Proceed, behind them lingering at my side,<br>
And saying: "When shall I again behold thee?"<br>
<br>"How long my life may last," said I, "I know not;<br>
This know, how soon soever I return,<br>
My wishes will before me have arriv'd.<br>
Sithence the place, where I am set to live,<br>
Is, day by day, more scoop'd of all its good,<br>
And dismal ruin seems to threaten it."<br>
<br>"Go now," he cried: "lo! he, whose guilt is most,<br>
Passes before my vision, dragg'd at heels<br>
Of an infuriate beast. &nbsp;Toward the vale,<br>
Where guilt hath no redemption, on it speeds,<br>
Each step increasing swiftness on the last;<br>
Until a blow it strikes, that leaveth him<br>
A corse most vilely shatter'd. &nbsp;No long space<br>
Those wheels have yet to roll" &nbsp;(therewith his eyes<br>
Look'd up to heav'n) "ere thou shalt plainly see<br>
That which my words may not more plainly tell.<br>
I quit thee: time is precious here: I lose<br>
Too much, thus measuring my pace with shine."<br>
<br>As from a troop of well-rank'd chivalry<br>
One knight, more enterprising than the rest,<br>
Pricks forth at gallop, eager to display<br>
His prowess in the first encounter prov'd<br>
So parted he from us with lengthen'd strides,<br>
And left me on the way with those twain spirits,<br>
Who were such mighty marshals of the world.<br>
<br>When he beyond us had so fled mine eyes<br>
No nearer reach'd him, than my thought his words,<br>
The branches of another fruit, thick hung,<br>
And blooming fresh, appear'd. &nbsp;E'en as our steps<br>
Turn'd thither, not far off it rose to view.<br>
Beneath it were a multitude, that rais'd<br>
Their hands, and shouted forth I know not What<br>
Unto the boughs; like greedy and fond brats,<br>
That beg, and answer none obtain from him,<br>
Of whom they beg; but more to draw them on,<br>
He at arm's length the object of their wish<br>
Above them holds aloft, and hides it not.<br>

<br><br><br><br>


<br>At length, as undeceiv'd they went their way:<br>
And we approach the tree, who vows and tears<br>
Sue to in vain, the mighty tree. &nbsp;"Pass on,<br>
And come not near. &nbsp;Stands higher up the wood,<br>
Whereof Eve tasted, and from it was ta'en<br>
'this plant." Such sounds from midst the thickets came.<br>
Whence I, with either bard, close to the side<br>
That rose, pass'd forth beyond. &nbsp;"Remember," next<br>
We heard, "those noblest creatures of the clouds,<br>
How they their twofold bosoms overgorg'd<br>
Oppos'd in fight to Theseus: call to mind<br>
The Hebrews, how effeminate they stoop'd<br>
To ease their thirst; whence Gideon's ranks were thinn'd,<br>
As he to Midian march'd adown the hills."<br>
<br>Thus near one border coasting, still we heard<br>
The sins of gluttony, with woe erewhile<br>
Reguerdon'd. &nbsp;Then along the lonely path,<br>
Once more at large, full thousand paces on<br>
We travel'd, each contemplative and mute.<br>
<br>"Why pensive journey thus ye three alone?"<br>
Thus suddenly a voice exclaim'd: whereat<br>
I shook, as doth a scar'd and paltry beast;<br>
Then rais'd my head to look from whence it came.<br>
<br>Was ne'er, in furnace, glass, or metal seen<br>
So bright and glowing red, as was the shape<br>
I now beheld. &nbsp;"If ye desire to mount,"<br>
He cried, "here must ye turn. &nbsp;This way he goes,<br>
Who goes in quest of peace." &nbsp;His countenance<br>
Had dazzled me; and to my guides I fac'd<br>
Backward, like one who walks, as sound directs.<br>
<br>As when, to harbinger the dawn, springs up<br>
On freshen'd wing the air of May, and breathes<br>
Of fragrance, all impregn'd with herb and flowers,<br>
E'en such a wind I felt upon my front<br>
Blow gently, and the moving of a wing<br>
Perceiv'd, that moving shed ambrosial smell;<br>
And then a voice: "Blessed are they, whom grace<br>
Doth so illume, that appetite in them<br>
Exhaleth no inordinate desire,<br>
Still hung'ring as the rule of temperance wills."</p>

<h2>CANTO XXV</h2>
<br>

<p>It was an hour, when he who climbs, had need<br>
To walk uncrippled: for the sun had now<br>
To Taurus the meridian circle left,<br>
And to the Scorpion left the night. &nbsp;As one<br>
That makes no pause, but presses on his road,<br>
Whate'er betide him, if some urgent need<br>
Impel: so enter'd we upon our way,<br>
One before other; for, but singly, none<br>
That steep and narrow scale admits to climb.<br>
<br>E'en as the young stork lifteth up his wing<br>
Through wish to fly, yet ventures not to quit<br>
The nest, and drops it; so in me desire<br>
Of questioning my guide arose, and fell,<br>
Arriving even to the act, that marks<br>
A man prepar'd for speech. &nbsp;Him all our haste<br>
Restrain'd not, but thus spake the sire belov'd:<br>
"Fear not to speed the shaft, that on thy lip<br>
Stands trembling for its flight." &nbsp;Encourag'd thus<br>
I straight began: "How there can leanness come,<br>
Where is no want of nourishment to feed?"<br>
<br>"If thou," he answer'd, "hadst remember'd thee,<br>
How Meleager with the wasting brand<br>
Wasted alike, by equal fires consum'd,<br>
This would not trouble thee: and hadst thou thought,<br>
How in the mirror your reflected form<br>
With mimic motion vibrates, what now seems<br>
Hard, had appear'd no harder than the pulp<br>
Of summer fruit mature. &nbsp;But that thy will<br>
In certainty may find its full repose,<br>
Lo Statius here! on him I call, and pray<br>
That he would now be healer of thy wound."<br>
<br>"If in thy presence I unfold to him<br>
The secrets of heaven's vengeance, let me plead<br>
Thine own injunction, to exculpate me."<br>
So Statius answer'd, and forthwith began:<br>
"Attend my words, O son, and in thy mind<br>
Receive them: so shall they be light to clear<br>
The doubt thou offer'st. Blood, concocted well,<br>
Which by the thirsty veins is ne'er imbib'd,<br>
And rests as food superfluous, to be ta'en<br>
From the replenish'd table, in the heart<br>
Derives effectual virtue, that informs<br>
The several human limbs, as being that,<br>
Which passes through the veins itself to make them.<br>
Yet more concocted it descends, where shame<br>
Forbids to mention: and from thence distils<br>
In natural vessel on another's blood.<br>
Then each unite together, one dispos'd<br>
T' endure, to act the other, through meet frame<br>
Of its recipient mould: that being reach'd,<br>
It 'gins to work, coagulating first;<br>
Then vivifies what its own substance caus'd<br>
To bear. &nbsp;With animation now indued,<br>
The active virtue (differing from a plant<br>
No further, than that this is on the way<br>
And at its limit that) continues yet<br>
To operate, that now it moves, and feels,<br>
As sea sponge clinging to the rock: and there<br>
Assumes th' organic powers its seed convey'd.<br>
'This is the period, son! at which the virtue,<br>
That from the generating heart proceeds,<br>
Is pliant and expansive; for each limb<br>
Is in the heart by forgeful nature plann'd.<br>
How babe of animal becomes, remains<br>
For thy consid'ring. &nbsp;At this point, more wise,<br>
Than thou hast err'd, making the soul disjoin'd<br>
From passive intellect, because he saw<br>
No organ for the latter's use assign'd.<br>
<br>"Open thy bosom to the truth that comes.<br>
Know soon as in the embryo, to the brain,<br>
Articulation is complete, then turns<br>
The primal Mover with a smile of joy<br>
On such great work of nature, and imbreathes<br>
New spirit replete with virtue, that what here<br>
Active it finds, to its own substance draws,<br>
And forms an individual soul, that lives,<br>
And feels, and bends reflective on itself.<br>
And that thou less mayst marvel at the word,<br>
Mark the sun's heat, how that to wine doth change,<br>
Mix'd with the moisture filter'd through the vine.<br>
<br>"When Lachesis hath spun the thread, the soul<br>
Takes with her both the human and divine,<br>
Memory, intelligence, and will, in act<br>
Far keener than before, the other powers<br>
Inactive all and mute. &nbsp;No pause allow'd,<br>
In wond'rous sort self-moving, to one strand<br>
Of those, where the departed roam, she falls,<br>
Here learns her destin'd path. &nbsp;Soon as the place<br>
Receives her, round the plastic virtue beams,<br>
Distinct as in the living limbs before:<br>
And as the air, when saturate with showers,<br>
The casual beam refracting, decks itself<br>
With many a hue; so here the ambient air<br>
Weareth that form, which influence of the soul<br>
Imprints on it; and like the flame, that where<br>
The fire moves, thither follows, so henceforth<br>
The new form on the spirit follows still:<br>
Hence hath it semblance, and is shadow call'd,<br>
With each sense even to the sight endued:<br>
Hence speech is ours, hence laughter, tears, and sighs<br>
Which thou mayst oft have witness'd on the mount<br>
Th' obedient shadow fails not to present<br>
Whatever varying passion moves within us.<br>
And this the cause of what thou marvel'st at."<br>

<br><br><br><br>


<br>Now the last flexure of our way we reach'd,<br>
And to the right hand turning, other care<br>
Awaits us. &nbsp;Here the rocky precipice<br>
Hurls forth redundant flames, and from the rim<br>
A blast upblown, with forcible rebuff<br>
Driveth them back, sequester'd from its bound.<br>
<br>Behoov'd us, one by one, along the side,<br>
That border'd on the void, to pass; and I<br>
Fear'd on one hand the fire, on th' other fear'd<br>
Headlong to fall: when thus th' instructor warn'd:<br>
"Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes.<br>
A little swerving and the way is lost."<br>

<br><br><br><br>


<br>Then from the bosom of the burning mass,<br>
"O God of mercy!" heard I sung; and felt<br>
No less desire to turn. &nbsp;And when I saw<br>
Spirits along the flame proceeding, I<br>
Between their footsteps and mine own was fain<br>
To share by turns my view. &nbsp;At the hymn's close<br>
They shouted loud, "I do not know a man;"<br>
Then in low voice again took up the strain,<br>
Which once more ended, "To the wood," they cried,<br>
"Ran Dian, and drave forth Callisto, stung<br>
With Cytherea's poison:" then return'd<br>
Unto their song; then marry a pair extoll'd,<br>
Who liv'd in virtue chastely, and the bands<br>
Of wedded love. &nbsp;Nor from that task, I ween,<br>
Surcease they; whilesoe'er the scorching fire<br>
Enclasps them. &nbsp;Of such skill appliance needs<br>
To medicine the wound, that healeth last.</p>
