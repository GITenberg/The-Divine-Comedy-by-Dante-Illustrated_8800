<h2>CANTO V</h2>
<br>

<p>Now had I left those spirits, and pursued<br>
The steps of my Conductor, when beheld<br>
Pointing the finger at me one exclaim'd:<br>
"See how it seems as if the light not shone<br>
From the left hand of him beneath, and he,<br>
As living, seems to be led on." &nbsp;Mine eyes<br>
I at that sound reverting, saw them gaze<br>
Through wonder first at me, and then at me<br>
And the light broken underneath, by turns.<br>
"Why are thy thoughts thus riveted?" &nbsp;my guide<br>
Exclaim'd, "that thou hast slack'd thy pace? &nbsp;or how<br>
Imports it thee, what thing is whisper'd here?<br>
Come after me, and to their babblings leave<br>
The crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set,<br>
Shakes not its top for any blast that blows!<br>
He, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out,<br>
Still of his aim is wide, in that the one<br>
Sicklies and wastes to nought the other's strength."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What other could I answer save "I come?"<br>
I said it, somewhat with that colour ting'd<br>
Which ofttimes pardon meriteth for man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came,<br>
A little way before us, some who sang<br>
The "Miserere" in responsive Strains.<br>
When they perceiv'd that through my body I<br>
Gave way not for the rays to pass, their song<br>
Straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they chang'd;<br>
And two of them, in guise of messengers,<br>
Ran on to meet us, and inquiring ask'd:<br>
"Of your condition we would gladly learn."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To them my guide. &nbsp;"Ye may return, and bear<br>
Tidings to them who sent you, that his frame<br>
Is real flesh. &nbsp;If, as I deem, to view<br>
His shade they paus'd, enough is answer'd them.<br>
Him let them honour, they may prize him well."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne'er saw I fiery vapours with such speed<br>
Cut through the serene air at fall of night,<br>
Nor August's clouds athwart the setting sun,<br>
That upward these did not in shorter space<br>
Return; and, there arriving, with the rest<br>
Wheel back on us, as with loose rein a troop.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/05-42.jpg"><img alt="05-42th.jpg (38K)" src="images/05-42th.jpg" height="477" width="428"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many," exclaim'd the bard, "are these, who throng<br>
Around us: to petition thee they come.<br>
Go therefore on, and listen as thou go'st."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O spirit! who go'st on to blessedness<br>
With the same limbs, that clad thee at thy birth."<br>
Shouting they came, "a little rest thy step.<br>
Look if thou any one amongst our tribe<br>
Hast e'er beheld, that tidings of him there<br>
Thou mayst report. &nbsp;Ah, wherefore go'st thou on?<br>
Ah wherefore tarriest thou not? &nbsp;We all<br>
By violence died, and to our latest hour<br>
Were sinners, but then warn'd by light from heav'n,<br>
So that, repenting and forgiving, we<br>
Did issue out of life at peace with God,<br>
Who with desire to see him fills our heart."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I: "The visages of all I scan<br>
Yet none of ye remember. &nbsp;But if aught,<br>
That I can do, may please you, gentle spirits!<br>
Speak; and I will perform it, by that peace,<br>
Which on the steps of guide so excellent<br>
Following from world to world intent I seek."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer he began: "None here distrusts<br>
Thy kindness, though not promis'd with an oath;<br>
So as the will fail not for want of power.<br>
Whence I, who sole before the others speak,<br>
Entreat thee, if thou ever see that land,<br>
Which lies between Romagna and the realm<br>
Of Charles, that of thy courtesy thou pray<br>
Those who inhabit Fano, that for me<br>
Their adorations duly be put up,<br>
By which I may purge off my grievous sins.<br>
From thence I came. &nbsp;But the deep passages,<br>
Whence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt,<br>
Upon my bosom in Antenor's land<br>
Were made, where to be more secure I thought.<br>
The author of the deed was Este's prince,<br>
Who, more than right could warrant, with his wrath<br>
Pursued me. &nbsp;Had I towards Mira fled,<br>
When overta'en at Oriaco, still<br>
Might I have breath'd. But to the marsh I sped,<br>
And in the mire and rushes tangled there<br>
Fell, and beheld my life-blood float the plain."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said another: "Ah! so may the wish,<br>
That takes thee o'er the mountain, be fulfill'd,<br>
As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine.<br>
Of Montefeltro I; Buonconte I:<br>
Giovanna nor none else have care for me,<br>
Sorrowing with these I therefore go." &nbsp;I thus:<br>
"From Campaldino's field what force or chance<br>
Drew thee, that ne'er thy sepulture was known?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh!" &nbsp;answer'd he, "at Casentino's foot<br>
A stream there courseth, nam'd Archiano, sprung<br>
In Apennine above the Hermit's seat.<br>
E'en where its name is cancel'd, there came I,<br>
Pierc'd in the heart, fleeing away on foot,<br>
And bloodying the plain. &nbsp;Here sight and speech<br>
Fail'd me, and finishing with Mary's name<br>
I fell, and tenantless my flesh remain'd.<br>
I will report the truth; which thou again<br>
Tell to the living. &nbsp;Me God's angel took,<br>
Whilst he of hell exclaim'd: "O thou from heav'n!<br>
Say wherefore hast thou robb'd me? &nbsp;Thou of him<br>
Th' eternal portion bear'st with thee away<br>
For one poor tear that he deprives me of.<br>
But of the other, other rule I make."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects<br>
That vapour dank, returning into water,<br>
Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it.<br>
That evil will, which in his intellect<br>
Still follows evil, came, and rais'd the wind<br>
And smoky mist, by virtue of the power<br>
Given by his nature. &nbsp;Thence the valley, soon<br>
As day was spent, he cover'd o'er with cloud<br>
From Pratomagno to the mountain range,<br>
And stretch'd the sky above, so that the air<br>
Impregnate chang'd to water. &nbsp;Fell the rain,<br>
And to the fosses came all that the land<br>
Contain'd not; and, as mightiest streams are wont,<br>
To the great river with such headlong sweep<br>
Rush'd, that nought stay'd its course. &nbsp;My stiffen'd frame<br>
Laid at his mouth the fell Archiano found,<br>
And dash'd it into Arno, from my breast<br>
Loos'ning the cross, that of myself I made<br>
When overcome with pain. &nbsp;He hurl'd me on,<br>
Along the banks and bottom of his course;<br>
Then in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt."<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! when thou to the world shalt be return'd,<br>
And rested after thy long road," so spake<br>
Next the third spirit; "then remember me.<br>
I once was Pia. &nbsp;Sienna gave me life,<br>
Maremma took it from me. &nbsp;That he knows,<br>
Who me with jewell'd ring had first espous'd."</p>

<h2>CANTO VI</h2>
<br>

<p>When from their game of dice men separate,<br>
He, who hath lost, remains in sadness fix'd,<br>
Revolving in his mind, what luckless throws<br>
He cast: but meanwhile all the company<br>
Go with the other; one before him runs,<br>
And one behind his mantle twitches, one<br>
Fast by his side bids him remember him.<br>
He stops not; and each one, to whom his hand<br>
Is stretch'd, well knows he bids him stand aside;<br>
And thus he from the press defends himself.<br>
E'en such was I in that close-crowding throng;<br>
And turning so my face around to all,<br>
And promising, I 'scap'd from it with pains.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here of Arezzo him I saw, who fell<br>
By Ghino's cruel arm; and him beside,<br>
Who in his chase was swallow'd by the stream.<br>
Here Frederic Novello, with his hand<br>
Stretch'd forth, entreated; and of Pisa he,<br>
Who put the good Marzuco to such proof<br>
Of constancy. &nbsp;Count Orso I beheld;<br>
And from its frame a soul dismiss'd for spite<br>
And envy, as it said, but for no crime:<br>
I speak of Peter de la Brosse; and here,<br>
While she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant<br>
Let her beware; lest for so false a deed<br>
She herd with worse than these. When I was freed<br>
From all those spirits, who pray'd for others' prayers<br>
To hasten on their state of blessedness;<br>
Straight I began: "O thou, my luminary!<br>
It seems expressly in thy text denied,<br>
That heaven's supreme decree can never bend<br>
To supplication; yet with this design<br>
Do these entreat. &nbsp;Can then their hope be vain,<br>
Or is thy saying not to me reveal'd?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thus to me: "Both what I write is plain,<br>
And these deceiv'd not in their hope, if well<br>
Thy mind consider, that the sacred height<br>
Of judgment doth not stoop, because love's flame<br>
In a short moment all fulfils, which he<br>
Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy.<br>
Besides, when I this point concluded thus,<br>
By praying no defect could be supplied;<br>
Because the pray'r had none access to God.<br>
Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not<br>
Contented unless she assure thee so,<br>
Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light.<br>
I know not if thou take me right; I mean<br>
Beatrice. &nbsp;Her thou shalt behold above,<br>
Upon this mountain's crown, fair seat of joy."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I: "Sir! let us mend our speed; for now<br>
I tire not as before; and lo! the hill<br>
Stretches its shadow far." &nbsp;He answer'd thus:<br>
"Our progress with this day shall be as much<br>
As we may now dispatch; but otherwise<br>
Than thou supposest is the truth. &nbsp;For there<br>
Thou canst not be, ere thou once more behold<br>
Him back returning, who behind the steep<br>
Is now so hidden, that as erst his beam<br>
Thou dost not break. &nbsp;But lo! a spirit there<br>
Stands solitary, and toward us looks:<br>
It will instruct us in the speediest way."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We soon approach'd it. &nbsp;O thou Lombard spirit!<br>
How didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood,<br>
Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes!<br>
It spoke not aught, but let us onward pass,<br>
Eyeing us as a lion on his watch.<br>
But Virgil with entreaty mild advanc'd,<br>
Requesting it to show the best ascent.<br>
It answer to his question none return'd,<br>
But of our country and our kind of life<br>
Demanded. &nbsp;When my courteous guide began,<br>
"Mantua," the solitary shadow quick<br>
Rose towards us from the place in which it stood,<br>
And cry'd, "Mantuan! I am thy countryman<br>
Sordello." &nbsp;Each the other then embrac'd.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah slavish Italy! thou inn of grief,<br>
Vessel without a pilot in loud storm,<br>
Lady no longer of fair provinces,<br>
But brothel-house impure! this gentle spirit,<br>
Ev'n from the Pleasant sound of his dear land<br>
Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen<br>
With such glad cheer; while now thy living ones<br>
In thee abide not without war; and one<br>
Malicious gnaws another, ay of those<br>
Whom the same wall and the same moat contains,<br>
Seek, wretched one! around thy sea-coasts wide;<br>
Then homeward to thy bosom turn, and mark<br>
If any part of the sweet peace enjoy.<br>
What boots it, that thy reins Justinian's hand<br>
Befitted, if thy saddle be unpress'd?<br>
Nought doth he now but aggravate thy shame.<br>
Ah people! thou obedient still shouldst live,<br>
And in the saddle let thy Caesar sit,<br>
If well thou marked'st that which God commands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look how that beast to felness hath relaps'd<br>
From having lost correction of the spur,<br>
Since to the bridle thou hast set thine hand,<br>
O German Albert! who abandon'st her,<br>
That is grown savage and unmanageable,<br>
When thou should'st clasp her flanks with forked heels.<br>
Just judgment from the stars fall on thy blood!<br>
And be it strange and manifest to all!<br>
Such as may strike thy successor with dread!<br>
For that thy sire and thou have suffer'd thus,<br>
Through greediness of yonder realms detain'd,<br>
The garden of the empire to run waste.<br>
Come see the Capulets and Montagues,<br>
The Philippeschi and Monaldi! man<br>
Who car'st for nought! those sunk in grief, and these<br>
With dire suspicion rack'd. Come, cruel one!<br>
Come and behold the' oppression of the nobles,<br>
And mark their injuries: and thou mayst see.<br>
What safety Santafiore can supply.<br>
Come and behold thy Rome, who calls on thee,<br>
Desolate widow! day and night with moans:<br>
"My Caesar, why dost thou desert my side?"<br>
Come and behold what love among thy people:<br>
And if no pity touches thee for us,<br>
Come and blush for thine own report. &nbsp;For me,<br>
If it be lawful, O Almighty Power,<br>
Who wast in earth for our sakes crucified!<br>
Are thy just eyes turn'd elsewhere? &nbsp;or is this<br>
A preparation in the wond'rous depth<br>
Of thy sage counsel made, for some good end,<br>
Entirely from our reach of thought cut off?<br>
So are the' Italian cities all o'erthrong'd<br>
With tyrants, and a great Marcellus made<br>
Of every petty factious villager.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Florence! thou mayst well remain unmov'd<br>
At this digression, which affects not thee:<br>
Thanks to thy people, who so wisely speed.<br>
Many have justice in their heart, that long<br>
Waiteth for counsel to direct the bow,<br>
Or ere it dart unto its aim: but shine<br>
Have it on their lip's edge. &nbsp;Many refuse<br>
To bear the common burdens: readier thine<br>
Answer uneall'd, and cry, "Behold I stoop!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make thyself glad, for thou hast reason now,<br>
Thou wealthy! thou at peace! thou wisdom-fraught!<br>
Facts best witness if I speak the truth.<br>
Athens and Lacedaemon, who of old<br>
Enacted laws, for civil arts renown'd,<br>
Made little progress in improving life<br>
Tow'rds thee, who usest such nice subtlety,<br>
That to the middle of November scarce<br>
Reaches the thread thou in October weav'st.<br>
How many times, within thy memory,<br>
Customs, and laws, and coins, and offices<br>
Have been by thee renew'd, and people chang'd!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou remember'st well and can'st see clear,<br>
Thou wilt perceive thyself like a sick wretch,<br>
Who finds no rest upon her down, but oft<br>
Shifting her side, short respite seeks from pain.</p>

<h2>CANTO VII</h2>
<br>

<p>After their courteous greetings joyfully<br>
Sev'n times exchang'd, Sordello backward drew<br>
Exclaiming, "Who are ye?" &nbsp;"Before this mount<br>
By spirits worthy of ascent to God<br>
Was sought, my bones had by Octavius' care<br>
Been buried. &nbsp;I am Virgil, for no sin<br>
Depriv'd of heav'n, except for lack of faith."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So answer'd him in few my gentle guide.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one, who aught before him suddenly<br>
Beholding, whence his wonder riseth, cries<br>
"It is yet is not," wav'ring in belief;<br>
Such he appear'd; then downward bent his eyes,<br>
And drawing near with reverential step,<br>
Caught him, where of mean estate might clasp<br>
His lord. &nbsp;"Glory of Latium!" he exclaim'd,<br>
"In whom our tongue its utmost power display'd!<br>
Boast of my honor'd birth-place! what desert<br>
Of mine, what favour rather undeserv'd,<br>
Shows thee to me? &nbsp;If I to hear that voice<br>
Am worthy, say if from below thou com'st<br>
And from what cloister's pale?"&mdash;"Through every orb<br>
Of that sad region," he reply'd, "thus far<br>
Am I arriv'd, by heav'nly influence led<br>
And with such aid I come. &nbsp;There is a place<br>
There underneath, not made by torments sad,<br>
But by dun shades alone; where mourning's voice<br>
Sounds not of anguish sharp, but breathes in sighs."<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/07-21.jpg"><img alt="07-21th.jpg (40K)" src="images/07-21th.jpg" height="477" width="433"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


There I with little innocents abide,<br>
Who by death's fangs were bitten, ere exempt<br>
From human taint. &nbsp;There I with those abide,<br>
Who the three holy virtues put not on,<br>
But understood the rest, and without blame<br>
Follow'd them all. &nbsp;But if thou know'st and canst,<br>
Direct us, how we soonest may arrive,<br>
Where Purgatory its true beginning takes."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answer'd thus: "We have no certain place<br>
Assign'd us: upwards I may go or round,<br>
Far as I can, I join thee for thy guide.<br>
But thou beholdest now how day declines:<br>
And upwards to proceed by night, our power<br>
Excels: therefore it may be well to choose<br>
A place of pleasant sojourn. &nbsp;To the right<br>
Some spirits sit apart retir'd. &nbsp;If thou<br>
Consentest, I to these will lead thy steps:<br>
And thou wilt know them, not without delight."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How chances this?" &nbsp;was answer'd; "who so wish'd<br>
To ascend by night, would he be thence debarr'd<br>
By other, or through his own weakness fail?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good Sordello then, along the ground<br>
Trailing his finger, spoke: "Only this line<br>
Thou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun<br>
Hath disappear'd; not that aught else impedes<br>
Thy going upwards, save the shades of night.<br>
These with the wont of power perplex the will.<br>
With them thou haply mightst return beneath,<br>
Or to and fro around the mountain's side<br>
Wander, while day is in the horizon shut."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My master straight, as wond'ring at his speech,<br>
Exclaim'd: "Then lead us quickly, where thou sayst,<br>
That, while we stay, we may enjoy delight."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little space we were remov'd from thence,<br>
When I perceiv'd the mountain hollow'd out.<br>
Ev'n as large valleys hollow'd out on earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That way," the' escorting spirit cried, "we go,<br>
Where in a bosom the high bank recedes:<br>
And thou await renewal of the day."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path<br>
Led us traverse into the ridge's side,<br>
Where more than half the sloping edge expires.<br>
Refulgent gold, and silver thrice refin'd,<br>
And scarlet grain and ceruse, Indian wood<br>
Of lucid dye serene, fresh emeralds<br>
But newly broken, by the herbs and flowers<br>
Plac'd in that fair recess, in color all<br>
Had been surpass'd, as great surpasses less.<br>
Nor nature only there lavish'd her hues,<br>
But of the sweetness of a thousand smells<br>
A rare and undistinguish'd fragrance made.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/07-82.jpg"><img alt="07-82th.jpg (43K)" src="images/07-82th.jpg" height="477" width="433"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Salve Regina," on the grass and flowers<br>
Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit<br>
Who not beyond the valley could be seen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the west'ring sun sink to his bed,"<br>
Began the Mantuan, who our steps had turn'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Mid those desires not that I lead ye on.<br>
For from this eminence ye shall discern<br>
Better the acts and visages of all,<br>
Than in the nether vale among them mix'd.<br>
He, who sits high above the rest, and seems<br>
To have neglected that he should have done,<br>
And to the others' song moves not his lip,<br>
The Emperor Rodolph call, who might have heal'd<br>
The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died,<br>
So that by others she revives but slowly,<br>
He, who with kindly visage comforts him,<br>
Sway'd in that country, where the water springs,<br>
That Moldaw's river to the Elbe, and Elbe<br>
Rolls to the ocean: Ottocar his name:<br>
Who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth<br>
Than Winceslaus his son, a bearded man,<br>
Pamper'd with rank luxuriousness and ease.<br>
And that one with the nose depress, who close<br>
In counsel seems with him of gentle look,<br>
Flying expir'd, with'ring the lily's flower.<br>
Look there how he doth knock against his breast!<br>
The other ye behold, who for his cheek<br>
Makes of one hand a couch, with frequent sighs.<br>
They are the father and the father-in-law<br>
Of Gallia's bane: his vicious life they know<br>
And foul; thence comes the grief that rends them thus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, so robust of limb, who measure keeps<br>
In song, with him of feature prominent,<br>
With ev'ry virtue bore his girdle brac'd.<br>
And if that stripling who behinds him sits,<br>
King after him had liv'd, his virtue then<br>
From vessel to like vessel had been pour'd;<br>
Which may not of the other heirs be said.<br>
By James and Frederick his realms are held;<br>
Neither the better heritage obtains.<br>
Rarely into the branches of the tree<br>
Doth human worth mount up; and so ordains<br>
He who bestows it, that as his free gift<br>
It may be call'd. &nbsp;To Charles my words apply<br>
No less than to his brother in the song;<br>
Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess.<br>
So much that plant degenerates from its seed,<br>
As more than Beatrice and Margaret<br>
Costanza still boasts of her valorous spouse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behold the king of simple life and plain,<br>
Harry of England, sitting there alone:<br>
He through his branches better issue spreads.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That one, who on the ground beneath the rest<br>
Sits lowest, yet his gaze directs aloft,<br>
Us William, that brave Marquis, for whose cause<br>
The deed of Alexandria and his war<br>
Makes Conferrat and Canavese weep."</p>

<h2>CANTO VIII</h2>
<br>

<p>Now was the hour that wakens fond desire<br>
In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart,<br>
Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell,<br>
And pilgrim newly on his road with love<br>
Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far,<br>
That seems to mourn for the expiring day:<br>
When I, no longer taking heed to hear<br>
Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark<br>
One risen from its seat, which with its hand<br>
Audience implor'd. Both palms it join'd and rais'd,<br>
Fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east,<br>
As telling God, "I care for naught beside."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Te Lucis Ante," so devoutly then<br>
Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain,<br>
That all my sense in ravishment was lost.<br>
And the rest after, softly and devout,<br>
Follow'd through all the hymn, with upward gaze<br>
Directed to the bright supernal wheels.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, reader! for the truth makes thine eyes keen:<br>
For of so subtle texture is this veil,<br>
That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark'd.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that gentle band silently next<br>
Look up, as if in expectation held,<br>
Pale and in lowly guise; and from on high<br>
I saw forth issuing descend beneath<br>
Two angels with two flame-illumin'd swords,<br>
Broken and mutilated at their points.<br>
Green as the tender leaves but newly born,<br>
Their vesture was, the which by wings as green<br>
Beaten, they drew behind them, fann'd in air.<br>
A little over us one took his stand,<br>
The other lighted on the' Opposing hill,<br>
So that the troop were in the midst contain'd.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I descried the whiteness on their heads;<br>
But in their visages the dazzled eye<br>
Was lost, as faculty that by too much<br>
Is overpower'd. &nbsp;"From Mary's bosom both<br>
Are come," exclaim'd Sordello, "as a guard<br>
Over the vale, ganst him, who hither tends,<br>
The serpent." &nbsp;Whence, not knowing by which path<br>
He came, I turn'd me round, and closely press'd,<br>
All frozen, to my leader's trusted side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sordello paus'd not: "To the valley now<br>
(For it is time) let us descend; and hold<br>
Converse with those great shadows: haply much<br>
Their sight may please ye." &nbsp;Only three steps down<br>
Methinks I measur'd, ere I was beneath,<br>
And noted one who look'd as with desire<br>
To know me. &nbsp;Time was now that air arrow dim;<br>
Yet not so dim, that 'twixt his eyes and mine<br>
It clear'd not up what was conceal'd before.<br>
Mutually tow'rds each other we advanc'd.<br>
Nino, thou courteous judge! what joy I felt,<br>
When I perceiv'd thou wert not with the bad!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No salutation kind on either part<br>
Was left unsaid. &nbsp;He then inquir'd: "How long<br>
Since thou arrived'st at the mountain's foot,<br>
Over the distant waves?"&mdash;"O!" answer'd I,<br>
"Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,<br>
And still in my first life, thus journeying on,<br>
The other strive to gain." &nbsp;Soon as they heard<br>
My words, he and Sordello backward drew,<br>
As suddenly amaz'd. &nbsp;To Virgil one,<br>
The other to a spirit turn'd, who near<br>
Was seated, crying: "Conrad! up with speed:<br>
Come, see what of his grace high God hath will'd."<br>
Then turning round to me: "By that rare mark<br>
Of honour which thou ow'st to him, who hides<br>
So deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,<br>
When thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves.<br>
Tell my Giovanna, that for me she call<br>
There, where reply to innocence is made.<br>
Her mother, I believe, loves me no more;<br>
Since she has chang'd the white and wimpled folds,<br>
Which she is doom'd once more with grief to wish.<br>
By her it easily may be perceiv'd,<br>
How long in women lasts the flame of love,<br>
If sight and touch do not relume it oft.<br>
For her so fair a burial will not make<br>
The viper which calls Milan to the field,<br>
As had been made by shrill Gallura's bird."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke, and in his visage took the stamp<br>
Of that right seal, which with due temperature<br>
Glows in the bosom. &nbsp;My insatiate eyes<br>
Meanwhile to heav'n had travel'd, even there<br>
Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel<br>
Nearest the axle; when my guide inquir'd:<br>
"What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answer'd: "The three torches, with which here<br>
The pole is all on fire." &nbsp;He then to me:<br>
"The four resplendent stars, thou saw'st this morn<br>
Are there beneath, and these ris'n in their stead."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While yet he spoke. &nbsp;Sordello to himself<br>
Drew him, and cry'd: "Lo there our enemy!"<br>
And with his hand pointed that way to look.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the side, where barrier none arose<br>
Around the little vale, a serpent lay,<br>
Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food.<br>
Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake<br>
Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;<br>
And, as a beast that smoothes its polish'd coat,<br>
Licking his hack. &nbsp;I saw not, nor can tell,<br>
How those celestial falcons from their seat<br>
Mov'd, but in motion each one well descried,<br>
Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes.<br>
The serpent fled; and to their stations back<br>
The angels up return'd with equal flight.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/frontispiece.jpg"><img alt="front2.jpg (41K)" src="images/front2.jpg" height="477" width="431"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spirit (who to Nino, when he call'd,<br>
Had come), from viewing me with fixed ken,<br>
Through all that conflict, loosen'd not his sight.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high,<br>
Find, in thy destin'd lot, of wax so much,<br>
As may suffice thee to the enamel's height."<br>
It thus began: "If any certain news<br>
Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part<br>
Thou know'st, tell me, who once was mighty there<br>
They call'd me Conrad Malaspina, not<br>
That old one, but from him I sprang. &nbsp;The love<br>
I bore my people is now here refin'd."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In your dominions," I answer'd, "ne'er was I.<br>
But through all Europe where do those men dwell,<br>
To whom their glory is not manifest?<br>
The fame, that honours your illustrious house,<br>
Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land;<br>
So that he knows it who was never there.<br>
I swear to you, so may my upward route<br>
Prosper! your honour'd nation not impairs<br>
The value of her coffer and her sword.<br>
Nature and use give her such privilege,<br>
That while the world is twisted from his course<br>
By a bad head, she only walks aright,<br>
And has the evil way in scorn." &nbsp;He then:<br>
"Now pass thee on: sev'n times the tired sun<br>
Revisits not the couch, which with four feet<br>
The forked Aries covers, ere that kind<br>
Opinion shall be nail'd into thy brain<br>
With stronger nails than other's speech can drive,<br>
If the sure course of judgment be not stay'd."</p>

<h2>CANTO IX</h2>

<br><br>
<a href="images/09-1.jpg"><img alt="09-1th.jpg (28K)" src="images/09-1th.jpg" height="458" width="428"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>Now the fair consort of Tithonus old,<br>
Arisen from her mate's beloved arms,<br>
Look'd palely o'er the eastern cliff: her brow,<br>
Lucent with jewels, glitter'd, set in sign<br>
Of that chill animal, who with his train<br>
Smites fearful nations: and where then we were,<br>
Two steps of her ascent the night had past,<br>
And now the third was closing up its wing,<br>
When I, who had so much of Adam with me,<br>
Sank down upon the grass, o'ercome with sleep,<br>
There where all five were seated. &nbsp;In that hour,<br>
When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay,<br>
Rememb'ring haply ancient grief, renews,<br>
And with our minds more wand'rers from the flesh,<br>
And less by thought restrain'd are, as 't were, full<br>
Of holy divination in their dreams,<br>
Then in a vision did I seem to view<br>
A golden-feather'd eagle in the sky,<br>
With open wings, and hov'ring for descent,<br>
And I was in that place, methought, from whence<br>
Young Ganymede, from his associates 'reft,<br>
Was snatch'd aloft to the high consistory.<br>
"Perhaps," thought I within me, "here alone<br>
He strikes his quarry, and elsewhere disdains<br>
To pounce upon the prey." &nbsp;Therewith, it seem'd,<br>
A little wheeling in his airy tour<br>
Terrible as the lightning rush'd he down,<br>
And snatch'd me upward even to the fire.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/09-29.jpg"><img alt="09-29th.jpg (42K)" src="images/09-29th.jpg" height="477" width="438"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


There both, I thought, the eagle and myself<br>
Did burn; and so intense th' imagin'd flames,<br>
That needs my sleep was broken off. &nbsp;As erst<br>
Achilles shook himself, and round him roll'd<br>
His waken'd eyeballs wond'ring where he was,<br>
Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled<br>
To Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms;<br>
E'en thus I shook me, soon as from my face<br>
The slumber parted, turning deadly pale,<br>
Like one ice-struck with dread. &nbsp;Solo at my side<br>
My comfort stood: and the bright sun was now<br>
More than two hours aloft: and to the sea<br>
My looks were turn'd. &nbsp;"Fear not," my master cried,<br>
"Assur'd we are at happy point. &nbsp;Thy strength<br>
Shrink not, but rise dilated. &nbsp;Thou art come<br>
To Purgatory now. &nbsp;Lo! there the cliff<br>
That circling bounds it! &nbsp;Lo! the entrance there,<br>
Where it doth seem disparted!  Ere the dawn<br>
Usher'd the daylight, when thy wearied soul<br>
Slept in thee, o'er the flowery vale beneath<br>
A lady came, and thus bespake me: I<br>
Am Lucia. &nbsp;Suffer me to take this man,<br>
Who slumbers. &nbsp;Easier so his way shall speed."<br>
Sordello and the other gentle shapes<br>
Tarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone,<br>
This summit reach'd: and I pursued her steps.<br>
Here did she place thee. &nbsp;First her lovely eyes<br>
That open entrance show'd me; then at once<br>
She vanish'd with thy sleep." &nbsp;Like one, whose doubts<br>
Are chas'd by certainty, and terror turn'd<br>
To comfort on discovery of the truth,<br>
Such was the change in me: and as my guide<br>
Beheld me fearless, up along the cliff<br>
He mov'd, and I behind him, towards the height.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reader! thou markest how my theme doth rise,<br>
Nor wonder therefore, if more artfully<br>
I prop the structure!  Nearer now we drew,<br>
Arriv'd' whence in that part, where first a breach<br>
As of a wall appear'd, I could descry<br>
A portal, and three steps beneath, that led<br>
For inlet there, of different colour each,<br>
And one who watch'd, but spake not yet a word.<br>
As more and more mine eye did stretch its view,<br>
I mark'd him seated on the highest step,<br>
In visage such, as past my power to bear.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/09-74.jpg"><img alt="09-74th.jpg (41K)" src="images/09-74th.jpg" height="541" width="429"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Grasp'd in his hand a naked sword, glanc'd back<br>
The rays so toward me, that I oft in vain<br>
My sight directed. &nbsp;"Speak from whence ye stand:"<br>
He cried: "What would ye? &nbsp;Where is your escort?<br>
Take heed your coming upward harm ye not."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A heavenly dame, not skilless of these things,"<br>
Replied the' instructor, "told us, even now,<br>
'Pass that way: here the gate is."&mdash;"And may she<br>
Befriending prosper your ascent," resum'd<br>
The courteous keeper of the gate: "Come then<br>
Before our steps." &nbsp;We straightway thither came.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest stair was marble white so smooth<br>
And polish'd, that therein my mirror'd form<br>
Distinct I saw. &nbsp;The next of hue more dark<br>
Than sablest grain, a rough and singed block,<br>
Crack'd lengthwise and across. &nbsp;The third, that lay<br>
Massy above, seem'd porphyry, that flam'd<br>
Red as the life-blood spouting from a vein.<br>
On this God's angel either foot sustain'd,<br>
Upon the threshold seated, which appear'd<br>
A rock of diamond. &nbsp;Up the trinal steps<br>
My leader cheerily drew me. &nbsp;"Ask," said he,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With humble heart, that he unbar the bolt."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piously at his holy feet devolv'd<br>
I cast me, praying him for pity's sake<br>
That he would open to me: but first fell<br>
Thrice on my bosom prostrate. &nbsp;Seven times<br>
The letter, that denotes the inward stain,<br>
He on my forehead with the blunted point<br>
Of his drawn sword inscrib'd. &nbsp;And "Look," he cried,<br>
"When enter'd, that thou wash these scars away."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashes, or earth ta'en dry out of the ground,<br>
Were of one colour with the robe he wore.<br>
From underneath that vestment forth he drew<br>
Two keys of metal twain: the one was gold,<br>
Its fellow silver. &nbsp;With the pallid first,<br>
And next the burnish'd, he so ply'd the gate,<br>
As to content me well. &nbsp;"Whenever one<br>
Faileth of these, that in the keyhole straight<br>
It turn not, to this alley then expect<br>
Access in vain." &nbsp;Such were the words he spake.<br>
"One is more precious: but the other needs<br>
Skill and sagacity, large share of each,<br>
Ere its good task to disengage the knot<br>
Be worthily perform'd. &nbsp;From Peter these<br>
I hold, of him instructed, that I err<br>
Rather in opening than in keeping fast;<br>
So but the suppliant at my feet implore."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then of that hallow'd gate he thrust the door,<br>
Exclaiming, "Enter, but this warning hear:<br>
He forth again departs who looks behind."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the hinges of that sacred ward<br>
The swivels turn'd, sonorous metal strong,<br>
Harsh was the grating; nor so surlily<br>
Roar'd the Tarpeian, when by force bereft<br>
Of good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss<br>
To leanness doom'd. &nbsp;Attentively I turn'd,<br>
List'ning the thunder, that first issued forth;<br>
And "We praise thee, O God," methought I heard<br>
In accents blended with sweet melody.<br>
The strains came o'er mine ear, e'en as the sound<br>
Of choral voices, that in solemn chant<br>
With organ mingle, and, now high and clear,<br>
Come swelling, now float indistinct away.</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO X</h2>
<br>

<p>When we had passed the threshold of the gate<br>
(Which the soul's ill affection doth disuse,<br>
Making the crooked seem the straighter path),<br>
I heard its closing sound. &nbsp;Had mine eyes turn'd,<br>
For that offence what plea might have avail'd?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We mounted up the riven rock, that wound<br>
On either side alternate, as the wave<br>
Flies and advances. &nbsp;"Here some little art<br>
Behooves us," said my leader, "that our steps<br>
Observe the varying flexure of the path."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb<br>
The moon once more o'erhangs her wat'ry couch,<br>
Ere we that strait have threaded. &nbsp;But when free<br>
We came and open, where the mount above<br>
One solid mass retires, I spent, with toil,<br>
And both, uncertain of the way, we stood,<br>
Upon a plain more lonesome, than the roads<br>
That traverse desert wilds. &nbsp;From whence the brink<br>
Borders upon vacuity, to foot<br>
Of the steep bank, that rises still, the space<br>
Had measur'd thrice the stature of a man:<br>
And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,<br>
To leftward now and now to right dispatch'd,<br>
That cornice equal in extent appear'd.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet our feet had on that summit mov'd,<br>
When I discover'd that the bank around,<br>
Whose proud uprising all ascent denied,<br>
Was marble white, and so exactly wrought<br>
With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone<br>
Had Polycletus, but e'en nature's self<br>
Been sham'd. &nbsp;The angel who came down to earth<br>
With tidings of the peace so many years<br>
Wept for in vain, that op'd the heavenly gates<br>
From their long interdict before us seem'd,<br>
In a sweet act, so sculptur'd to the life,<br>
He look'd no silent image. One had sworn<br>
He had said, "Hail!" for she was imag'd there,<br>
By whom the key did open to God's love,<br>
And in her act as sensibly impress<br>
That word, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord,"<br>
As figure seal'd on wax. &nbsp;"Fix not thy mind<br>
On one place only," said the guide belov'd,<br>
Who had me near him on that part where lies<br>
The heart of man. &nbsp;My sight forthwith I turn'd<br>
And mark'd, behind the virgin mother's form,<br>
Upon that side, where he, that mov'd me, stood,<br>
Another story graven on the rock.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I passed athwart the bard, and drew me near,<br>
That it might stand more aptly for my view.<br>
There in the self-same marble were engrav'd<br>
The cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark,<br>
That from unbidden office awes mankind.<br>
Before it came much people; and the whole<br>
Parted in seven quires. &nbsp;One sense cried, "Nay,"<br>
Another, "Yes, they sing." &nbsp;Like doubt arose<br>
Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl'd fume<br>
Of incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.<br>
Preceding the blest vessel, onward came<br>
With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,<br>
Sweet Israel's harper: in that hap he seem'd<br>
Less and yet more than kingly. &nbsp;Opposite,<br>
At a great palace, from the lattice forth<br>
Look'd Michol, like a lady full of scorn<br>
And sorrow. &nbsp;To behold the tablet next,<br>
Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone,<br>
I mov'd me. &nbsp;There was storied on the rock<br>
The' exalted glory of the Roman prince,<br>
Whose mighty worth mov'd Gregory to earn<br>
His mighty conquest, Trajan th' Emperor.<br>
A widow at his bridle stood, attir'd<br>
In tears and mourning. &nbsp;Round about them troop'd<br>
Full throng of knights, and overhead in gold<br>
The eagles floated, struggling with the wind.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/10-74.jpg"><img alt="10-74th.jpg (40K)" src="images/10-74th.jpg" height="476" width="433"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


The wretch appear'd amid all these to say:<br>
"Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart<br>
My son is murder'd." &nbsp;He replying seem'd;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait now till I return." And she, as one<br>
Made hasty by her grief; "O sire, if thou<br>
Dost not return?"&mdash;"Where I am, who then is,<br>
May right thee."&mdash;"What to thee is other's good,<br>
If thou neglect thy own?"&mdash;"Now comfort thee,"<br>
At length he answers. &nbsp;"It beseemeth well<br>
My duty be perform'd, ere I move hence:<br>
So justice wills; and pity bids me stay."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, whose ken nothing new surveys, produc'd<br>
That visible speaking, new to us and strange<br>
The like not found on earth. &nbsp;Fondly I gaz'd<br>
Upon those patterns of meek humbleness,<br>
Shapes yet more precious for their artist's sake,<br>
When "Lo," the poet whisper'd, "where this way<br>
(But slack their pace), a multitude advance.<br>
These to the lofty steps shall guide us on."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights<br>
Their lov'd allurement, were not slow to turn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reader! I would not that amaz'd thou miss<br>
Of thy good purpose, hearing how just God<br>
Decrees our debts be cancel'd. &nbsp;Ponder not<br>
The form of suff'ring. &nbsp;Think on what succeeds,<br>
Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom<br>
It cannot pass. &nbsp;"Instructor," I began,<br>
"What I see hither tending, bears no trace<br>
Of human semblance, nor of aught beside<br>
That my foil'd sight can guess." &nbsp;He answering thus:<br>
"So courb'd to earth, beneath their heavy teems<br>
Of torment stoop they, that mine eye at first<br>
Struggled as thine. &nbsp;But look intently thither,<br>
An disentangle with thy lab'ring view,<br>
What underneath those stones approacheth: now,<br>
E'en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christians and proud!  O poor and wretched ones!<br>
That feeble in the mind's eye, lean your trust<br>
Upon unstaid perverseness!  Know ye not<br>
That we are worms, yet made at last to form<br>
The winged insect, imp'd with angel plumes<br>
That to heaven's justice unobstructed soars?<br>
Why buoy ye up aloft your unfleg'd souls?<br>
Abortive then and shapeless ye remain,<br>
Like the untimely embryon of a worm!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As, to support incumbent floor or roof,<br>
For corbel is a figure sometimes seen,<br>
That crumples up its knees unto its breast,<br>
With the feign'd posture stirring ruth unfeign'd<br>
In the beholder's fancy; so I saw<br>
These fashion'd, when I noted well their guise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each, as his back was laden, came indeed<br>
Or more or less contract; but it appear'd<br>
As he, who show'd most patience in his look,<br>
Wailing exclaim'd: "I can endure no more."</p>
