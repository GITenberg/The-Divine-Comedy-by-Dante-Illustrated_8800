<h2>CANTO XI</h2>
<br>

<p>"O thou Almighty Father, who dost make<br>
The heavens thy dwelling, not in bounds confin'd,<br>
But that with love intenser there thou view'st<br>
Thy primal effluence, hallow'd be thy name:<br>
Join each created being to extol<br>
Thy might, for worthy humblest thanks and praise<br>
Is thy blest Spirit. &nbsp;May thy kingdom's peace<br>
Come unto us; for we, unless it come,<br>
With all our striving thither tend in vain.<br>
As of their will the angels unto thee<br>
Tender meet sacrifice, circling thy throne<br>
With loud hosannas, so of theirs be done<br>
By saintly men on earth. &nbsp;Grant us this day<br>
Our daily manna, without which he roams<br>
Through this rough desert retrograde, who most<br>
Toils to advance his steps. &nbsp;As we to each<br>
Pardon the evil done us, pardon thou<br>
Benign, and of our merit take no count.<br>
'Gainst the old adversary prove thou not<br>
Our virtue easily subdu'd; but free<br>
From his incitements and defeat his wiles.<br>
This last petition, dearest Lord! is made<br>
Not for ourselves, since that were needless now,<br>
But for their sakes who after us remain."<br>
<br>Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring,<br>
Those spirits went beneath a weight like that<br>
We sometimes feel in dreams, all, sore beset,<br>
But with unequal anguish, wearied all,<br>
Round the first circuit, purging as they go,<br>
The world's gross darkness off: In our behalf<br>
If there vows still be offer'd, what can here<br>
For them be vow'd and done by such, whose wills<br>
Have root of goodness in them? &nbsp;Well beseems<br>
That we should help them wash away the stains<br>
They carried hence, that so made pure and light,<br>
They may spring upward to the starry spheres.<br>
<br>"Ah! &nbsp;so may mercy-temper'd justice rid<br>
Your burdens speedily, that ye have power<br>
To stretch your wing, which e'en to your desire<br>
Shall lift you, as ye show us on which hand<br>
Toward the ladder leads the shortest way.<br>
And if there be more passages than one,<br>
Instruct us of that easiest to ascend;<br>
For this man who comes with me, and bears yet<br>
The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him,<br>
Despite his better will but slowly mounts."<br>
From whom the answer came unto these words,<br>
Which my guide spake, appear'd not; but 'twas said.<br>
<br>"Along the bank to rightward come with us,<br>
And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil<br>
Of living man to climb: and were it not<br>
That I am hinder'd by the rock, wherewith<br>
This arrogant neck is tam'd, whence needs I stoop<br>
My visage to the ground, him, who yet lives,<br>
Whose name thou speak'st not him I fain would view.<br>
To mark if e'er I knew him? &nbsp;and to crave<br>
His pity for the fardel that I bear.<br>
I was of Latiun, &nbsp;of a Tuscan horn<br>
A mighty one: Aldobranlesco's name<br>
My sire's, I know not if ye e'er have heard.<br>
My old blood and forefathers' gallant deeds<br>
Made me so haughty, that I clean forgot<br>
The common mother, and to such excess,<br>
Wax'd in my scorn of all men, that I fell,<br>
Fell therefore; by what fate Sienna's sons,<br>
Each child in Campagnatico, can tell.<br>
I am Omberto; not me only pride<br>
Hath injur'd, but my kindred all involv'd<br>
In mischief with her. &nbsp;Here my lot ordains<br>
Under this weight to groan, till I appease<br>
God's angry justice, since I did it not<br>
Amongst the living, here amongst the dead."<br>
<br>List'ning I bent my visage down: and one<br>
(Not he who spake) twisted beneath the weight<br>
That urg'd him, saw me, knew me straight, and call'd,<br>
Holding his eyes With difficulty fix'd<br>
Intent upon me, stooping as I went<br>
Companion of their way. &nbsp;"O!" &nbsp;I exclaim'd,<br>
<br>"Art thou not Oderigi, art not thou<br>
Agobbio's glory, glory of that art<br>
Which they of Paris call the limmer's skill?"<br>
<br>"Brother!" said he, "with tints that gayer smile,<br>
Bolognian Franco's pencil lines the leaves.<br>
His all the honour now; mine borrow'd light.<br>
In truth I had not been thus courteous to him,<br>
The whilst I liv'd, through eagerness of zeal<br>
For that pre-eminence my heart was bent on.<br>
Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid.<br>
Nor were I even here; if, able still<br>
To sin, I had not turn'd me unto God.<br>
O powers of man! &nbsp;how vain your glory, nipp'd<br>
E'en in its height of verdure, if an age<br>
Less bright succeed not! &nbsp;Cimabue thought<br>
To lord it over painting's field; and now<br>
The cry is Giotto's, and his name eclips'd.<br>
Thus hath one Guido from the other snatch'd<br>
The letter'd prize: and he perhaps is born,<br>
Who shall drive either from their nest. &nbsp;The noise<br>
Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind,<br>
That blows from divers points, and shifts its name<br>
Shifting the point it blows from. &nbsp;Shalt thou more<br>
Live in the mouths of mankind, if thy flesh<br>
Part shrivel'd from thee, than if thou hadst died,<br>
Before the coral and the pap were left,<br>
Or ere some thousand years have passed? and that<br>
Is, to eternity compar'd, a space,<br>
Briefer than is the twinkling of an eye<br>
To the heaven's slowest orb. &nbsp;He there who treads<br>
So leisurely before me, far and wide<br>
Through Tuscany resounded once; and now<br>
Is in Sienna scarce with whispers nam'd:<br>
There was he sov'reign, when destruction caught<br>
The madd'ning rage of Florence, in that day<br>
Proud as she now is loathsome. &nbsp;Your renown<br>
Is as the herb, whose hue doth come and go,<br>
And his might withers it, by whom it sprang<br>
Crude from the lap of earth." &nbsp;I thus to him:<br>
"True are thy sayings: to my heart they breathe<br>
The kindly spirit of meekness, and allay<br>
What tumours rankle there. &nbsp;But who is he<br>
Of whom thou spak'st but now?"--"This," he replied,<br>
"Is Provenzano. &nbsp;He is here, because<br>
He reach'd, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway<br>
Of all Sienna. &nbsp;Thus he still hath gone,<br>
Thus goeth never-resting, since he died.<br>
Such is th' acquittance render'd back of him,<br>
Who, beyond measure, dar'd on earth." &nbsp;I then:<br>
"If soul that to the verge of life delays<br>
Repentance, linger in that lower space,<br>
Nor hither mount, unless good prayers befriend,<br>
How chanc'd admittance was vouchsaf'd to him?"<br>
<br>"When at his glory's topmost height," said he,<br>
"Respect of dignity all cast aside,<br>
Freely He fix'd him on Sienna's plain,<br>
A suitor to &nbsp;redeem his suff'ring friend,<br>
Who languish'd in the prison-house of Charles,<br>
Nor for his sake refus'd through every vein<br>
To tremble. &nbsp;More I will not say; and dark,<br>
I know, my words are, but thy neighbours soon<br>
Shall help thee to a comment on the text.<br>
This is the work, that from these limits freed him."</p>

<h2>CANTO XII</h2>

<p>With equal pace as oxen in the yoke,<br>
I with that laden spirit journey'd on<br>
Long as the mild instructor suffer'd me;<br>
But when he bade me quit him, and proceed<br>
(For "here," said he, "behooves with sail and oars<br>
Each man, as best he may, push on his bark"),<br>
Upright, as one dispos'd for speed, I rais'd<br>
My body, still in thought submissive bow'd.<br>
<br>I now my leader's track not loth pursued;<br>
And each had shown how light we far'd along<br>
When thus he warn'd me: "Bend thine eyesight down:<br>
For thou to ease the way shall find it good<br>
To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet."<br>
<br>As in memorial of the buried, drawn<br>
Upon earth-level tombs, the sculptur'd form<br>
Of what was once, appears (at sight whereof<br>
Tears often stream forth by remembrance wak'd,<br>
Whose sacred stings the piteous only feel),<br>
So saw I there, but with more curious skill<br>
Of portraiture o'erwrought, whate'er of space<br>
From forth the mountain stretches. &nbsp;On one part<br>
Him I beheld, above all creatures erst<br>
Created noblest, light'ning fall from heaven:<br>
On th' other side with bolt celestial pierc'd<br>
Briareus: cumb'ring earth he lay through dint<br>
Of mortal ice-stroke. &nbsp;The Thymbraean god<br>
With Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire,<br>
Arm'd still, and gazing on the giant's limbs<br>
Strewn o'er th' ethereal field. &nbsp;Nimrod I saw:<br>
At foot of the stupendous work he stood,<br>
As if bewilder'd, looking on the crowd<br>
Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar's plain.<br>
<br>O Niobe! &nbsp;in what a trance of woe<br>
Thee I beheld, upon that highway drawn,<br>
Sev'n sons on either side thee slain! &nbsp;O Saul!<br>
How ghastly didst thou look! &nbsp;on thine own sword<br>
Expiring in Gilboa, from that hour<br>
Ne'er visited with rain from heav'n or dew!<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/12-39.jpg"><img alt="12-39th.jpg (40K)" src="images/12-39th.jpg" height="465" width="434"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>O fond Arachne! &nbsp;thee I also saw<br>
Half spider now in anguish crawling up<br>
Th' unfinish'd web thou weaved'st to thy bane!<br>
<br>O Rehoboam! &nbsp;here thy shape doth seem<br>
Louring no more defiance! but fear-smote<br>
With none to chase him in his chariot whirl'd.<br>
<br>Was shown beside upon the solid floor<br>
How dear Alcmaeon forc'd his mother rate<br>
That ornament in evil hour receiv'd:<br>
How in the temple on Sennacherib fell<br>
His sons, and how a corpse they left him there.<br>
Was shown the scath and cruel mangling made<br>
By Tomyris on Cyrus, when she cried:<br>
"Blood thou didst thirst for, take thy fill of blood!"<br>
Was shown how routed in the battle fled<br>
Th' Assyrians, Holofernes slain, and e'en<br>
The relics of the carnage. &nbsp;Troy I mark'd<br>
In ashes and in caverns. &nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;how fall'n,<br>
How abject, Ilion, was thy semblance there!<br>
<br>What master of the pencil or the style<br>
Had trac'd the shades and lines, that might have made<br>
The subtlest workman wonder? &nbsp;Dead the dead,<br>
The living seem'd alive; with clearer view<br>
His eye beheld not who beheld the truth,<br>
Than mine what I did tread on, while I went<br>
Low bending. &nbsp;Now swell out; and with stiff necks<br>
Pass on, ye sons of Eve! &nbsp;veil not your looks,<br>
Lest they descry the evil of your path!<br>
<br>I noted not (so busied was my thought)<br>
How much we now had circled of the mount,<br>
And of his course yet more the sun had spent,<br>
When he, who with still wakeful caution went,<br>
Admonish'd: "Raise thou up thy head: for know<br>
Time is not now for slow suspense. &nbsp;Behold<br>
That way an angel hasting towards us! &nbsp;Lo<br>
Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return<br>
From service on the day. &nbsp;Wear thou in look<br>
And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe,<br>
That gladly he may forward us aloft.<br>
Consider that this day ne'er dawns again."<br>
<br>Time's loss he had so often warn'd me 'gainst,<br>
I could not miss the scope at which he aim'd.<br>
<br>The goodly shape approach'd us, snowy white<br>
In vesture, and with visage casting streams<br>
Of tremulous lustre like the matin star.<br>
His arms he open'd, then his wings; and spake:<br>
"Onward: the steps, behold! &nbsp;are near; and now<br>
Th' ascent is without difficulty gain'd."<br>
<br>A scanty few are they, who when they hear<br>
Such tidings, hasten. &nbsp;O ye race of men<br>
Though born to soar, why suffer ye a wind<br>
So slight to baffle ye? &nbsp;He led us on<br>
Where the rock parted; here against my front<br>
Did beat his wings, then promis'd I should fare<br>
In safety on my way. &nbsp;As to ascend<br>
That steep, upon whose brow the chapel stands<br>
(O'er Rubaconte, looking lordly down<br>
On the well-guided city,) up the right<br>
Th' impetuous rise is broken by the steps<br>
Carv'd in that old and simple age, when still<br>
The registry and label rested safe;<br>
Thus is th' acclivity reliev'd, which here<br>
Precipitous from the other circuit falls:<br>
But on each hand the tall cliff presses close.<br>
<br>As ent'ring there we turn'd, voices, in strain<br>
Ineffable, sang: "Blessed are the poor<br>
In spirit." &nbsp;Ah how far unlike to these<br>
The straits of hell; here songs to usher us,<br>
There shrieks of woe! &nbsp;We climb the holy stairs:<br>
And lighter to myself by far I seem'd<br>
Than on the plain before, whence thus I spake:<br>
"Say, master, of what heavy thing have I<br>
Been lighten'd, that scarce aught the sense of toil<br>
Affects me journeying?" &nbsp;He in few replied:<br>
"When sin's broad characters, that yet remain<br>
Upon thy temples, though well nigh effac'd,<br>
Shall be, as one is, all clean razed out,<br>
Then shall thy feet by heartiness of will<br>
Be so o'ercome, they not alone shall feel<br>
No sense of labour, but delight much more<br>
Shall wait them urg'd along their upward way."<br>
<br>Then like to one, upon whose head is plac'd<br>
Somewhat he deems not of but from the becks<br>
Of others as they pass him by; his hand<br>
Lends therefore help to' assure him, searches, finds,<br>
And well performs such office as the eye<br>
Wants power to execute: so stretching forth<br>
The fingers of my right hand, did I find<br>
Six only of the letters, which his sword<br>
Who bare the keys had trac'd upon my brow.<br>
The leader, as he mark'd mine action, smil'd.</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XIII</h2>
<br>

<p>We reach'd the summit of the scale, and stood<br>
Upon the second buttress of that mount<br>
Which healeth him who climbs. &nbsp;A cornice there,<br>
Like to the former, girdles round the hill;<br>
Save that its arch with sweep less ample bends.<br>
<br>Shadow nor image there is seen; all smooth<br>
The rampart and the path, reflecting nought<br>
But the rock's sullen hue. &nbsp;"If here we wait<br>
For some to question," said the bard, "I fear<br>
Our choice may haply meet too long delay."<br>
<br>Then fixedly upon the sun his eyes<br>
He fastn'd, made his right the central point<br>
From whence to move, and turn'd the left aside.<br>
"O pleasant light, my confidence and hope,<br>
Conduct us thou," he cried, "on this new way,<br>
Where now I venture, leading to the bourn<br>
We seek. &nbsp;The universal world to thee<br>
Owes warmth and lustre. &nbsp;If no other cause<br>
Forbid, thy beams should ever be our guide."<br>
<br>Far, as is measur'd for a mile on earth,<br>
In brief space had we journey'd; such prompt will<br>
Impell'd; and towards us flying, now were heard<br>
Spirits invisible, who courteously<br>
Unto love's table bade the welcome guest.<br>
The voice, that first? &nbsp;flew by, call'd forth aloud,<br>
"They have no wine;" so on behind us past,<br>
Those sounds reiterating, nor yet lost<br>
In the faint distance, when another came<br>
Crying, "I am Orestes," and alike<br>
Wing'd its fleet way. &nbsp;"Oh father!" &nbsp;I exclaim'd,<br>
"What tongues are these?" &nbsp;and as I question'd, lo!<br>
A third exclaiming, "Love ye those have wrong'd you."<br>
<br>"This circuit," said my teacher, "knots the scourge<br>
For envy, and the cords are therefore drawn<br>
By charity's correcting hand. &nbsp;The curb<br>
Is of a harsher sound, as thou shalt hear<br>
(If I deem rightly), ere thou reach the pass,<br>
Where pardon sets them free. &nbsp;But fix thine eyes<br>
Intently through the air, and thou shalt see<br>
A multitude before thee seated, each<br>
Along the shelving grot." &nbsp;Then more than erst<br>
I op'd my eyes, before me view'd, and saw<br>
Shadows with garments dark as was the rock;<br>
And when we pass'd a little forth, I heard<br>
A crying, "Blessed Mary! pray for us,<br>
Michael and Peter! &nbsp;all ye saintly host!"<br>
<br>I do not think there walks on earth this day<br>
Man so remorseless, that he hath not yearn'd<br>
With pity at the sight that next I saw.<br>
Mine eyes a load of sorrow teemed, when now<br>
I stood so near them, that their semblances<br>
Came clearly to my view. &nbsp;Of sackcloth vile<br>
Their cov'ring seem'd; and on his shoulder one<br>
Did stay another, leaning, and all lean'd<br>
Against the cliff. &nbsp;E'en thus the blind and poor,<br>
Near the confessionals, to crave an alms,<br>
Stand, each his head upon his fellow's sunk,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/13-55.jpg"><img alt="13-55th.jpg (47K)" src="images/13-55th.jpg" height="553" width="439"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


So most to stir compassion, not by sound<br>
Of words alone, but that, which moves not less,<br>
The sight of mis'ry. &nbsp;And as never beam<br>
Of noonday visiteth the eyeless man,<br>
E'en so was heav'n a niggard unto these<br>
Of his fair light; for, through the orbs of all,<br>
A thread of wire, impiercing, knits them up,<br>
As for the taming of a haggard hawk.<br>
<br>It were a wrong, methought, to pass and look<br>
On others, yet myself the while unseen.<br>
To my sage counsel therefore did I turn.<br>
He knew the meaning of the mute appeal,<br>
Nor waited for my questioning, but said:<br>
"Speak; and be brief, be subtle in thy words."<br>
<br>On that part of the cornice, whence no rim<br>
Engarlands its steep fall, did Virgil come;<br>
On the' other side me were the spirits, their cheeks<br>
Bathing devout with penitential tears,<br>
That through the dread impalement forc'd a way.<br>
<br>I turn'd me to them, and "O shades!" said I,<br>
<br>"Assur'd that to your eyes unveil'd shall shine<br>
The lofty light, sole object of your wish,<br>
So may heaven's grace clear whatsoe'er of foam<br>
Floats turbid on the conscience, that thenceforth<br>
The stream of mind roll limpid from its source,<br>
As ye declare (for so shall ye impart<br>
A boon I dearly prize) if any soul<br>
Of Latium dwell among ye; and perchance<br>
That soul may profit, if I learn so much."<br>
<br>"My brother, we are each one citizens<br>
Of one true city. &nbsp;Any thou wouldst say,<br>
Who lived a stranger in Italia's land."<br>
<br>So heard I answering, as appeal'd, a voice<br>
That onward came some space from whence I stood.<br>
<br>A spirit I noted, in whose look was mark'd<br>
Expectance. &nbsp;Ask ye how? &nbsp;The chin was rais'd<br>
As in one reft of sight. &nbsp;"Spirit," said I,<br>
"Who for thy rise are tutoring (if thou be<br>
That which didst answer to me,) or by place<br>
Or name, disclose thyself, that I may know thee."<br>
<br>"I was," it answer'd, "of Sienna: here<br>
I cleanse away with these the evil life,<br>
Soliciting with tears that He, who is,<br>
Vouchsafe him to us. &nbsp;Though Sapia nam'd<br>
In sapience I excell'd not, gladder far<br>
Of others' hurt, than of the good befell me.<br>
That thou mayst own I now deceive thee not,<br>
Hear, if my folly were not as I speak it.<br>
When now my years slop'd waning down the arch,<br>
It so bechanc'd, my fellow citizens<br>
Near Colle met their enemies in the field,<br>
And I pray'd God to grant what He had will'd.<br>
There were they vanquish'd, and betook themselves<br>
Unto the bitter passages of flight.<br>
I mark'd the hunt, and waxing out of bounds<br>
In gladness, lifted up my shameless brow,<br>
And like the merlin cheated by a gleam,<br>
Cried, "It is over. &nbsp;Heav'n! I fear thee not."<br>
Upon my verge of life I wish'd for peace<br>
With God; nor repentance had supplied<br>
What I did lack of duty, were it not<br>
The hermit Piero, touch'd with charity,<br>
In his devout orisons thought on me.<br>
"But who art thou that question'st of our state,<br>
Who go'st to my belief, with lids unclos'd,<br>
And breathest in thy talk?"--"Mine eyes," said I,<br>
"May yet be here ta'en from me; but not long;<br>
For they have not offended grievously<br>
With envious glances. &nbsp;But the woe beneath<br>
Urges my soul with more exceeding dread.<br>
That nether load already weighs me down."<br>
<br>She thus: "Who then amongst us here aloft<br>
Hath brought thee, if thou weenest to return?"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/13-129.jpg"><img alt="13-129th.jpg (49K)" src="images/13-129th.jpg" height="545" width="433"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>"He," answer'd I, "who standeth mute beside me.<br>
I live: of me ask therefore, chosen spirit,<br>
If thou desire I yonder yet should move<br>
For thee my mortal feet."--"Oh!" she replied,<br>
"This is so strange a thing, it is great sign<br>
That God doth love thee. &nbsp;Therefore with thy prayer<br>
Sometime assist me: and by that I crave,<br>
Which most thou covetest, that if thy feet<br>
E'er tread on Tuscan soil, thou save my fame<br>
Amongst my kindred. &nbsp;Them shalt thou behold<br>
With that vain multitude, who set their hope<br>
On Telamone's haven, there to fail<br>
Confounded, more shall when the fancied stream<br>
They sought of Dian call'd: but they who lead<br>
Their navies, more than ruin'd hopes shall mourn."</p>

<h2>CANTO XIV</h2>
<br>

<p>"Say who is he around our mountain winds,<br>
Or ever death has prun'd his wing for flight,<br>
That opes his eyes and covers them at will?"<br>
<br>"I know not who he is, but know thus much<br>
He comes not singly. &nbsp;Do thou ask of him,<br>
For thou art nearer to him, and take heed<br>
Accost him gently, so that he may speak."<br>
<br>Thus on the right two Spirits bending each<br>
Toward the other, talk'd of me, then both<br>
Addressing me, their faces backward lean'd,<br>
And thus the one began: "O soul, who yet<br>
Pent in the body, tendest towards the sky!<br>
For charity, we pray thee' comfort us,<br>
Recounting whence thou com'st, and who thou art:<br>
For thou dost make us at the favour shown thee<br>
Marvel, as at a thing that ne'er hath been."<br>
<br>"There stretches through the midst of Tuscany,"<br>
I straight began: "a brooklet, whose well-head<br>
Springs up in Falterona, with his race<br>
Not satisfied, when he some hundred miles<br>
Hath measur'd. &nbsp;From his banks bring, I this frame.<br>
To tell you who I am were words misspent:<br>
For yet my name scarce sounds on rumour's lip."<br>
<br>"If well I do incorp'rate with my thought<br>
The meaning of thy speech," said he, who first<br>
Addrest me, "thou dost speak of Arno's wave."<br>
<br>To whom the other: "Why hath he conceal'd<br>
The title of that river, as a man<br>
Doth of some horrible thing?" &nbsp;The spirit, who<br>
Thereof was question'd, did acquit him thus:<br>
"I know not: but 'tis fitting well the name<br>
Should perish of that vale; for from the source<br>
Where teems so plenteously the Alpine steep<br>
Maim'd of Pelorus, (that doth scarcely pass<br>
Beyond that limit,) even to the point<br>
Whereunto ocean is restor'd, what heaven<br>
Drains from th' exhaustless store for all earth's streams,<br>
Throughout the space is virtue worried down,<br>
As 'twere a snake, by all, for mortal foe,<br>
Or through disastrous influence on the place,<br>
Or else distortion of misguided wills,<br>
That custom goads to evil: whence in those,<br>
The dwellers in that miserable vale,<br>
Nature is so transform'd, it seems as they<br>
Had shar'd of Circe's feeding. &nbsp;'Midst brute swine,<br>
Worthier of acorns than of other food<br>
Created for man's use, he shapeth first<br>
His obscure way; then, sloping onward, finds<br>
Curs, snarlers more in spite than power, from whom<br>
He turns with scorn aside: still journeying down,<br>
By how much more the curst and luckless foss<br>
Swells out to largeness, e'en so much it finds<br>
Dogs turning into wolves. &nbsp;Descending still<br>
Through yet more hollow eddies, next he meets<br>
A race of foxes, so replete with craft,<br>
They do not fear that skill can master it.<br>
Nor will I cease because my words are heard<br>
By other ears than thine. &nbsp;It shall be well<br>
For this man, if he keep in memory<br>
What from no erring Spirit I reveal.<br>
Lo! &nbsp;I behold thy grandson, that becomes<br>
A hunter of those wolves, upon the shore<br>
Of the fierce stream, and cows them all with dread:<br>
Their flesh yet living sets he up to sale,<br>
Then like an aged beast to slaughter dooms.<br>
Many of life he reaves, himself of worth<br>
And goodly estimation. &nbsp;Smear'd with gore<br>
Mark how he issues from the rueful wood,<br>
Leaving such havoc, that in thousand years<br>
It spreads not to prime lustihood again."<br>
<br>As one, who tidings hears of woe to come,<br>
Changes his looks perturb'd, from whate'er part<br>
The peril grasp him, so beheld I change<br>
That spirit, who had turn'd to listen, struck<br>
With sadness, soon as he had caught the word.<br>
<br>His visage and the other's speech did raise<br>
Desire in me to know the names of both,<br>
whereof with meek entreaty I inquir'd.<br>
<br>The shade, who late addrest me, thus resum'd:<br>
"Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do<br>
For thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine.<br>
But since God's will is that so largely shine<br>
His grace in thee, I will be liberal too.<br>
Guido of Duca know then that I am.<br>
Envy so parch'd my blood, that had I seen<br>
A fellow man made joyous, thou hadst mark'd<br>
A livid paleness overspread my cheek.<br>
Such harvest reap I of the seed I sow'd.<br>
O man, why place thy heart where there doth need<br>
Exclusion of participants in good?<br>
This is Rinieri's spirit, this the boast<br>
And honour of the house of Calboli,<br>
Where of his worth no heritage remains.<br>
Nor his the only blood, that hath been stript<br>
('twixt Po, the mount, the Reno, and the shore,)<br>
Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss;<br>
But in those limits such a growth has sprung<br>
Of rank and venom'd roots, as long would mock<br>
Slow culture's toil. &nbsp;Where is good Lizio? &nbsp;where<br>
Manardi, Traversalo, and Carpigna?<br>
O bastard slips of old Romagna's line!<br>
When in Bologna the low artisan,<br>
And in Faenza yon Bernardin sprouts,<br>
A gentle cyon from ignoble stem.<br>
Wonder not, Tuscan, if thou see me weep,<br>
When I recall to mind those once lov'd names,<br>
Guido of Prata, and of Azzo him<br>
That dwelt with you; Tignoso and his troop,<br>
With Traversaro's house and Anastagio's,<br>
(Each race disherited) and beside these,<br>
The ladies and the knights, the toils and ease,<br>
That witch'd us into love and courtesy;<br>
Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts.<br>
O Brettinoro! &nbsp;wherefore tarriest still,<br>
Since forth of thee thy family hath gone,<br>
And many, hating evil, join'd their steps?<br>
Well doeth he, that bids his lineage cease,<br>
Bagnacavallo; Castracaro ill,<br>
And Conio worse, who care to propagate<br>
A race of Counties from such blood as theirs.<br>
Well shall ye also do, Pagani, then<br>
When from amongst you tries your demon child.<br>
Not so, howe'er, that henceforth there remain<br>
True proof of what ye were. &nbsp;O Hugolin!<br>
Thou sprung of Fantolini's line! &nbsp;thy name<br>
Is safe, since none is look'd for after thee<br>
To cloud its lustre, warping from thy stock.<br>
But, Tuscan, go thy ways; for now I take<br>
Far more delight in weeping than in words.<br>
Such pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart."<br>
<br>We knew those gentle spirits at parting heard<br>
Our steps. &nbsp;Their silence therefore of our way<br>
Assur'd us. &nbsp;Soon as we had quitted them,<br>
Advancing onward, lo! &nbsp;a voice that seem'd<br>
Like vollied light'ning, when it rives the air,<br>
Met us, and shouted, "Whosoever finds<br>
Will slay me," then fled from us, as the bolt<br>
Lanc'd sudden from a downward-rushing cloud.<br>
When it had giv'n short truce unto our hearing,<br>
Behold the other with a crash as loud<br>
As the quick-following thunder: "Mark in me<br>
Aglauros turn'd to rock." &nbsp;I at the sound<br>
Retreating drew more closely to my guide.<br>
<br>Now in mute stillness rested all the air:<br>
And thus he spake: "There was the galling bit.<br>
But your old enemy so baits his hook,<br>
He drags you eager to him. &nbsp;Hence nor curb<br>
Avails you, nor reclaiming call. &nbsp;Heav'n calls<br>
And round about you wheeling courts your gaze<br>
With everlasting beauties. &nbsp;Yet your eye<br>
Turns with fond doting still upon the earth.<br>
Therefore He smites you who discerneth all."</p>

<h2>CANTO XV</h2>
<br>

<p>As much as 'twixt the third hour's close and dawn,<br>
Appeareth of heav'n's sphere, that ever whirls<br>
As restless as an infant in his play,<br>
So much appear'd remaining to the sun<br>
Of his slope journey towards the western goal.<br>
<br>Evening was there, and here the noon of night;<br>
and full upon our forehead smote the beams.<br>
For &nbsp;round the mountain, circling, so our path<br>
Had led us, that toward the sun-set now<br>
Direct we journey'd: when I felt a weight<br>
Of more exceeding splendour, than before,<br>
Press on my front. &nbsp;The cause unknown, amaze<br>
Possess'd me, and both hands against my brow<br>
Lifting, I interpos'd them, as a screen,<br>
That of its gorgeous superflux of light<br>
Clipp'd the diminish'd orb. As when the ray,<br>
Striking On water or the surface clear<br>
Of mirror, leaps unto the opposite part,<br>
Ascending at a glance, e'en as it fell,<br>
(And so much differs from the stone, that falls)<br>
Through equal space, as practice skill hath shown;<br>
Thus with refracted light before me seemed<br>
The ground there smitten; whence in sudden haste<br>
My sight recoil'd. &nbsp;"What is this, sire belov'd!<br>
'Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain?"<br>
Cried I, "and which towards us moving seems?"<br>
<br>"Marvel not, if the family of heav'n,"<br>
He answer'd, "yet with dazzling radiance dim<br>
Thy sense it is a messenger who comes,<br>
Inviting man's ascent. &nbsp;Such sights ere long,<br>
Not grievous, shall impart to thee delight,<br>
As thy perception is by nature wrought<br>
Up to their pitch." &nbsp;The blessed angel, soon<br>
As we had reach'd him, hail'd us with glad voice:<br>
"Here enter on a ladder far less steep<br>
Than ye have yet encounter'd." &nbsp;We forthwith<br>
Ascending, heard behind us chanted sweet,<br>
"Blessed the merciful," and "happy thou!<br>
That conquer'st." &nbsp;Lonely each, my guide and I<br>
Pursued our upward way; and as we went,<br>
Some profit from his words I hop'd to win,<br>
And thus of him inquiring, fram'd my speech:<br>
<br>"What meant Romagna's spirit, when he spake<br>
Of bliss exclusive with no partner shar'd?"<br>
<br>He straight replied: "No wonder, since he knows,<br>
What sorrow waits on his own worst defect,<br>
If he chide others, that they less may mourn.<br>
Because ye point your wishes at a mark,<br>
Where, by communion of possessors, part<br>
Is lessen'd, envy bloweth up the sighs of men.<br>
No fear of that might touch ye, if the love<br>
Of higher sphere exalted your desire.<br>
For there, by how much more they call it ours,<br>
So much propriety of each in good<br>
Increases more, and heighten'd charity<br>
Wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame."<br>
<br>"Now lack I satisfaction more," said I,<br>
"Than if thou hadst been silent at the first,<br>
And doubt more gathers on my lab'ring thought.<br>
How can it chance, that good distributed,<br>
The many, that possess it, makes more rich,<br>
Than if 't were shar'd by few?" &nbsp;He answering thus:<br>
"Thy mind, reverting still to things of earth,<br>
Strikes darkness from true light. &nbsp;The highest good<br>
Unlimited, ineffable, doth so speed<br>
To love, as beam to lucid body darts,<br>
Giving as much of ardour as it finds.<br>
The sempiternal effluence streams abroad<br>
Spreading, wherever charity extends.<br>
So that the more aspirants to that bliss<br>
Are multiplied, more good is there to love,<br>
And more is lov'd; as mirrors, that reflect,<br>
Each unto other, propagated light.<br>
If these my words avail not to allay<br>
Thy thirsting, Beatrice thou shalt see,<br>
Who of this want, and of all else thou hast,<br>
Shall rid thee to the full. &nbsp;Provide but thou<br>
That from thy temples may be soon eras'd,<br>
E'en as the two already, those five scars,<br>
That when they pain thee worst, then kindliest heal,"<br>
<br>"Thou," I had said, "content'st me," when I saw<br>
The other round was gain'd, and wond'ring eyes<br>
Did keep me mute. &nbsp;There suddenly I seem'd<br>
By an ecstatic vision wrapt away;<br>
And in a temple saw, methought, a crowd<br>
Of many persons; and at th' entrance stood<br>
A dame, whose sweet demeanour did express<br>
A mother's love, who said, "Child! &nbsp;why hast thou<br>
Dealt with us thus? &nbsp;Behold thy sire and I<br>
Sorrowing have sought thee;" and so held her peace,<br>
And straight the vision fled. &nbsp;A female next<br>
Appear'd before me, down whose visage cours'd<br>
Those waters, that grief forces out from one<br>
By deep resentment stung, who seem'd to say:<br>
"If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed<br>
Over this city, nam'd with such debate<br>
Of adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles,<br>
Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace<br>
Hath clasp'd our daughter; "and to fuel, meseem'd,<br>
Benign and meek, with visage undisturb'd,<br>
Her sovran spake: "How shall we those requite,<br>
Who wish us evil, if we thus condemn<br>
The man that loves us?" &nbsp;After that I saw<br>
A multitude, in fury burning, slay<br>
With stones a stripling youth, and shout amain<br>
"Destroy, destroy!" and him I saw, who bow'd<br>
Heavy with death unto the ground, yet made<br>
His eyes, unfolded upward, gates to heav'n,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/15-103.jpg"><img alt="15-103th.jpg (38K)" src="images/15-103th.jpg" height="445" width="432"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Praying forgiveness of th' Almighty Sire,<br>
Amidst that cruel conflict, on his foes,<br>
With looks, that With compassion to their aim.<br>
<br>Soon as my spirit, from her airy flight<br>
Returning, sought again the things, whose truth<br>
Depends not on her shaping, I observ'd<br>
How she had rov'd to no unreal scenes<br>
<br>Meanwhile the leader, who might see I mov'd,<br>
As one, who struggles to shake off his sleep,<br>
Exclaim'd: "What ails thee, that thou canst not hold<br>
Thy footing firm, but more than half a league<br>
Hast travel'd with clos'd eyes and tott'ring gait,<br>
Like to a man by wine or sleep o'ercharg'd?"<br>
<br>"Beloved father! &nbsp;so thou deign," said I,<br>
"To listen, I will tell thee what appear'd<br>
Before me, when so fail'd my sinking steps."<br>
<br>He thus: "Not if thy Countenance were mask'd<br>
With hundred vizards, could a thought of thine<br>
How small soe'er, elude me. &nbsp;What thou saw'st<br>
Was shown, that freely thou mightst ope thy heart<br>
To the waters of peace, that flow diffus'd<br>
From their eternal fountain. &nbsp;I not ask'd,<br>
What ails thee? &nbsp;for such cause as he doth, who<br>
Looks only with that eye which sees no more,<br>
When spiritless the body lies; but ask'd,<br>
To give fresh vigour to thy foot. &nbsp;Such goads<br>
The slow and loit'ring need; that they be found<br>
Not wanting, when their hour of watch returns."<br>
<br>So on we journey'd through the evening sky<br>
Gazing intent, far onward, as our eyes<br>
With level view could stretch against the bright<br>
Vespertine ray: and lo! &nbsp;by slow degrees<br>
Gath'ring, a fog made tow'rds us, dark as night.<br>
There was no room for 'scaping; and that mist<br>
Bereft us, both of sight and the pure air.</p>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XVI</h2>
<br>

<p>Hell's dunnest gloom, or night unlustrous, dark,<br>
Of every planes 'reft, and pall'd in clouds,<br>
Did never spread before the sight a veil<br>
In thickness like that fog, nor to the sense<br>
So palpable and gross. &nbsp;Ent'ring its shade,<br>
Mine eye endured not with unclosed lids;<br>
Which marking, near me drew the faithful guide,<br>
Offering me his shoulder for a stay.<br>
<br>As the blind man behind his leader walks,<br>
Lest he should err, or stumble unawares<br>
On what might harm him, or perhaps destroy,<br>
I journey'd through that bitter air and foul,<br>
Still list'ning to my escort's warning voice,<br>
"Look that from me thou part not." &nbsp;Straight I heard<br>
Voices, and each one seem'd to pray for peace,<br>
And for compassion, to the Lamb of God<br>
That taketh sins away. &nbsp;Their prelude still<br>
Was "Agnus Dei," and through all the choir,<br>
One voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem'd<br>
The concord of their song. &nbsp;"Are these I hear<br>
Spirits, O master?" &nbsp;I exclaim'd; and he:<br>
"Thou aim'st aright: these loose the bonds of wrath."<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/16-23.jpg"><img alt="16-23th.jpg (42K)" src="images/16-23th.jpg" height="477" width="435"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>"Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave?<br>
And speak'st of us, as thou thyself e'en yet<br>
Dividest time by calends?" &nbsp;So one voice<br>
Bespake me; whence my master said: "Reply;<br>
And ask, if upward hence the passage lead."<br>
<br>"O being! &nbsp;who dost make thee pure, to stand<br>
Beautiful once more in thy Maker's sight!<br>
Along with me: and thou shalt hear and wonder."<br>
Thus I, whereto the spirit answering spake:<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/16-32.jpg"><img alt="16-32th.jpg (37K)" src="images/16-32th.jpg" height="455" width="434"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


"Long as 't is lawful for me, shall my steps<br>
Follow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke<br>
Forbids the seeing, hearing in its stead<br>
Shall keep us join'd." &nbsp;I then forthwith began<br>
"Yet in my mortal swathing, I ascend<br>
To higher regions, and am hither come<br>
Through the fearful agony of hell.<br>
And, if so largely God hath doled his grace,<br>
That, clean beside all modern precedent,<br>
He wills me to behold his kingly state,<br>
From me conceal not who thou wast, ere death<br>
Had loos'd thee; but instruct me: and instruct<br>
If rightly to the pass I tend; thy words<br>
The way directing as a safe escort."<br>
<br>"I was of Lombardy, and Marco call'd:<br>
Not inexperienc'd of the world, that worth<br>
I still affected, from which all have turn'd<br>
The nerveless bow aside. &nbsp;Thy course tends right<br>
Unto the summit:" and, replying thus,<br>
He added, "I beseech thee pray for me,<br>
When thou shalt come aloft." &nbsp;And I to him:<br>
"Accept my faith for pledge I will perform<br>
What thou requirest. &nbsp;Yet one doubt remains,<br>
That wrings me sorely, if I solve it not,<br>
Singly before it urg'd me, doubled now<br>
By thine opinion, when I couple that<br>
With one elsewhere declar'd, each strength'ning other.<br>
The world indeed is even so forlorn<br>
Of all good as thou speak'st it and so swarms<br>
With every evil. &nbsp;Yet, beseech thee, point<br>
The cause out to me, that myself may see,<br>
And unto others show it: for in heaven<br>
One places it, and one on earth below."<br>
<br>Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh,<br>
"Brother!" he thus began, "the world is blind;<br>
And thou in truth com'st from it. &nbsp;Ye, who live,<br>
Do so each cause refer to heav'n above,<br>
E'en as its motion of necessity<br>
Drew with it all that moves. &nbsp;If this were so,<br>
Free choice in you were none; nor justice would<br>
There should be joy for virtue, woe for ill.<br>
Your movements have their primal bent from heaven;<br>
Not all; yet said I all; what then ensues?<br>
Light have ye still to follow evil or good,<br>
And of the will free power, which, if it stand<br>
Firm and unwearied in Heav'n's first assay,<br>
Conquers at last, so it be cherish'd well,<br>
Triumphant over all. &nbsp;To mightier force,<br>
To better nature subject, ye abide<br>
Free, not constrain'd by that, which forms in you<br>
The reasoning mind uninfluenc'd of the stars.<br>
If then the present race of mankind err,<br>
Seek in yourselves the cause, and find it there.<br>
Herein thou shalt confess me no false spy.<br>
<br>"Forth from his plastic hand, who charm'd beholds<br>
Her image ere she yet exist, the soul<br>
Comes like a babe, that wantons sportively<br>
Weeping and laughing in its wayward moods,<br>
As artless and as ignorant of aught,<br>
Save that her Maker being one who dwells<br>
With gladness ever, willingly she turns<br>
To whate'er yields her joy. &nbsp;Of some slight good<br>
The flavour soon she tastes; and, snar'd by that,<br>
With fondness she pursues it, if no guide<br>
Recall, no rein direct her wand'ring course.<br>
Hence it behov'd, the law should be a curb;<br>
A sovereign hence behov'd, whose piercing view<br>
Might mark at least the fortress and main tower<br>
Of the true city. &nbsp;Laws indeed there are:<br>
But who is he observes them? &nbsp;None; not he,<br>
Who goes before, the shepherd of the flock,<br>
Who chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof.<br>
Therefore the multitude, who see their guide<br>
Strike at the very good they covet most,<br>
Feed there and look no further. &nbsp;Thus the cause<br>
Is not corrupted nature in yourselves,<br>
But ill-conducting, that hath turn'd the world<br>
To evil. &nbsp;Rome, that turn'd it unto good,<br>
Was wont to boast two suns, whose several beams<br>
Cast light on either way, the world's and God's.<br>
One since hath quench'd the other; and the sword<br>
Is grafted on the crook; and so conjoin'd<br>
Each must perforce decline to worse, unaw'd<br>
By fear of other. &nbsp;If thou doubt me, mark<br>
The blade: each herb is judg'd of by its seed.<br>
That land, through which Adice and the Po<br>
Their waters roll, was once the residence<br>
Of courtesy and velour, ere the day,<br>
That frown'd on Frederick; now secure may pass<br>
Those limits, whosoe'er hath left, for shame,<br>
To talk with good men, or come near their haunts.<br>
Three aged ones are still found there, in whom<br>
The old time chides the new: these deem it long<br>
Ere God restore them to a better world:<br>
The good Gherardo, of Palazzo he<br>
Conrad, and Guido of Castello, nam'd<br>
In Gallic phrase more fitly the plain Lombard.<br>
On this at last conclude. &nbsp;The church of Rome,<br>
Mixing two governments that ill assort,<br>
Hath miss'd her footing, fall'n into the mire,<br>
And there herself and burden much defil'd."<br>
<br>"O Marco!" I replied, shine arguments<br>
Convince me: and the cause I now discern<br>
Why of the heritage no portion came<br>
To Levi's offspring. &nbsp;But resolve me this<br>
Who that Gherardo is, that as thou sayst<br>
Is left a sample of the perish'd race,<br>
And for rebuke to this untoward age?"<br>
<br>"Either thy words," said he, "deceive; or else<br>
Are meant to try me; that thou, speaking Tuscan,<br>
Appear'st not to have heard of good Gherado;<br>
The sole addition that, by which I know him;<br>
Unless I borrow'd from his daughter Gaia<br>
Another name to grace him. &nbsp;God be with you.<br>
I bear you company no more. &nbsp;Behold<br>
The dawn with white ray glimm'ring through the mist.<br>
I must away--the angel comes--ere he<br>
Appear." &nbsp;He said, and would not hear me more.</p>

<h2>CANTO XVII</h2>
<br>

<p>Call to remembrance, reader, if thou e'er<br>
Hast, on a mountain top, been ta'en by cloud,<br>
Through which thou saw'st no better, than the mole<br>
Doth through opacous membrane; then, whene'er<br>
The wat'ry vapours dense began to melt<br>
Into thin air, how faintly the sun's sphere<br>
Seem'd wading through them; so thy nimble thought<br>
May image, how at first I re-beheld<br>
The sun, that bedward now his couch o'erhung.<br>
<br>Thus with my leader's feet still equaling pace<br>
From forth that cloud I came, when now expir'd<br>
The parting beams from off the nether shores.<br>
<br>O quick and forgetive power! &nbsp;that sometimes dost<br>
So rob us of ourselves, we take no mark<br>
Though round about us thousand trumpets clang!<br>
What moves thee, if the senses stir not? &nbsp;Light<br>
Kindled in heav'n, spontaneous, self-inform'd,<br>
Or likelier gliding down with swift illapse<br>
By will divine. &nbsp;Portray'd before me came<br>
The traces of her dire impiety,<br>
Whose form was chang'd into the bird, that most<br>
Delights itself in song: and here my mind<br>
Was inwardly so wrapt, it gave no place<br>
To aught that ask'd admittance from without.<br>
<br>Next shower'd into my fantasy a shape<br>
As of one crucified, whose visage spake<br>
Fell rancour, malice deep, wherein he died;<br>
And round him Ahasuerus the great king,<br>
Esther his bride, and Mordecai the just,<br>
Blameless in word and deed. &nbsp;As of itself<br>
That unsubstantial coinage of the brain<br>
Burst, like a bubble, Which the water fails<br>
That fed it; in my vision straight uprose<br>
A damsel weeping loud, and cried, "O queen!<br>
O mother! &nbsp;wherefore has intemperate ire<br>
Driv'n thee to loath thy being? &nbsp;Not to lose<br>
Lavinia, desp'rate thou hast slain thyself.<br>
Now hast thou lost me. &nbsp;I am she, whose tears<br>
Mourn, ere I fall, a mother's timeless end."<br>
<br>E'en as a sleep breaks off, if suddenly<br>
New radiance strike upon the closed lids,<br>
The broken slumber quivering ere it dies;<br>
Thus from before me sunk that imagery<br>
Vanishing, soon as on my face there struck<br>
The light, outshining far our earthly beam.<br>
As round I turn'd me to survey what place<br>
I had arriv'd at, "Here ye mount," exclaim'd<br>
A voice, that other purpose left me none,<br>
Save will so eager to behold who spake,<br>
I could not choose but gaze. &nbsp;As 'fore the sun,<br>
That weighs our vision down, and veils his form<br>
In light transcendent, thus my virtue fail'd<br>
Unequal. &nbsp;"This is Spirit from above,<br>
Who marshals us our upward way, unsought;<br>
And in his own light shrouds him. As a man<br>
Doth for himself, so now is done for us.<br>
For whoso waits imploring, yet sees need<br>
Of his prompt aidance, sets himself prepar'd<br>
For blunt denial, ere the suit be made.<br>
Refuse we not to lend a ready foot<br>
At such inviting: haste we to ascend,<br>
Before it darken: for we may not then,<br>
Till morn again return." &nbsp;So spake my guide;<br>
And to one ladder both address'd our steps;<br>
And the first stair approaching, I perceiv'd<br>
Near me as 'twere the waving of a wing,<br>
That fann'd my face and whisper'd: "Blessed they<br>
The peacemakers: they know not evil wrath."<br>
<br>Now to such height above our heads were rais'd<br>
The last beams, follow'd close by hooded night,<br>
That many a star on all sides through the gloom<br>
Shone out. &nbsp;"Why partest from me, O my strength?"<br>
So with myself I commun'd; for I felt<br>
My o'ertoil'd sinews slacken. &nbsp;We had reach'd<br>
The summit, and were fix'd like to a bark<br>
Arriv'd at land. &nbsp;And waiting a short space,<br>
If aught should meet mine ear in that new round,<br>
Then to my guide I turn'd, and said: "Lov'd sire!<br>
Declare what guilt is on this circle purg'd.<br>
If our feet rest, no need thy speech should pause."<br>
<br>He thus to me: "The love of good, whate'er<br>
Wanted of just proportion, here fulfils.<br>
Here plies afresh the oar, that loiter'd ill.<br>
But that thou mayst yet clearlier understand,<br>
Give ear unto my words, and thou shalt cull<br>
Some fruit may please thee well, from this delay.<br>
<br>"Creator, nor created being, ne'er,<br>
My son," he thus began, "was without love,<br>
Or natural, or the free spirit's growth.<br>
Thou hast not that to learn. &nbsp;The natural still<br>
Is without error; but the other swerves,<br>
If on ill object bent, or through excess<br>
Of vigour, or defect. &nbsp;While e'er it seeks<br>
The primal blessings, or with measure due<br>
Th' inferior, no delight, that flows from it,<br>
Partakes of ill. &nbsp;But let it warp to evil,<br>
Or with more ardour than behooves, or less.<br>
Pursue the good, the thing created then<br>
Works 'gainst its Maker. &nbsp;Hence thou must infer<br>
That love is germin of each virtue in ye,<br>
And of each act no less, that merits pain.<br>
Now since it may not be, but love intend<br>
The welfare mainly of the thing it loves,<br>
All from self-hatred are secure; and since<br>
No being can be thought t' exist apart<br>
And independent of the first, a bar<br>
Of equal force restrains from hating that.<br>
<br>"Grant the distinction just; and it remains<br>
The' evil must be another's, which is lov'd.<br>
Three ways such love is gender'd in your clay.<br>
There is who hopes (his neighbour's worth deprest,)<br>
Preeminence himself, and coverts hence<br>
For his own greatness that another fall.<br>
There is who so much fears the loss of power,<br>
Fame, favour, glory (should his fellow mount<br>
Above him), and so sickens at the thought,<br>
He loves their opposite: and there is he,<br>
Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame<br>
That he doth thirst for vengeance, and such needs<br>
Must doat on other's evil. &nbsp;Here beneath<br>
This threefold love is mourn'd. &nbsp;Of th' other sort<br>
Be now instructed, that which follows good<br>
But with disorder'd and irregular course.<br>
<br>"All indistinctly apprehend a bliss<br>
On which the soul may rest, the hearts of all<br>
Yearn after it, and to that wished bourn<br>
All therefore strive to tend. &nbsp;If ye behold<br>
Or seek it with a love remiss and lax,<br>
This cornice after just repenting lays<br>
Its penal torment on ye. &nbsp;Other good<br>
There is, where man finds not his happiness:<br>
It is not true fruition, not that blest<br>
Essence, of every good the branch and root.<br>
The love too lavishly bestow'd on this,<br>
Along three circles over us, is mourn'd.<br>
Account of that division tripartite<br>
Expect not, fitter for thine own research."</p>

<h2>CANTO XVIII</h2>
<br>

<p>The teacher ended, and his high discourse<br>
Concluding, earnest in my looks inquir'd<br>
If I appear'd content; and I, whom still<br>
Unsated thirst to hear him urg'd, was mute,<br>
Mute outwardly, yet inwardly I said:<br>
"Perchance my too much questioning offends."<br>
But he, true father, mark'd the secret wish<br>
By diffidence restrain'd, and speaking, gave<br>
Me boldness thus to speak: "Master, my Sight<br>
Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams,<br>
That all, thy words convey, distinct is seen.<br>
Wherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart<br>
Holds dearest! &nbsp;thou wouldst deign by proof t' unfold<br>
That love, from which as from their source thou bring'st<br>
All good deeds and their opposite." &nbsp;He then:<br>
"To what I now disclose be thy clear ken<br>
Directed, and thou plainly shalt behold<br>
How much those blind have err'd, who make themselves<br>
The guides of men. &nbsp;The soul, created apt<br>
To love, moves versatile which way soe'er<br>
Aught pleasing prompts her, soon as she is wak'd<br>
By pleasure into act. &nbsp;Of substance true<br>
Your apprehension forms its counterfeit,<br>
And in you the ideal shape presenting<br>
Attracts the soul's regard. &nbsp;If she, thus drawn,<br>
incline toward it, love is that inclining,<br>
And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.<br>
Then as the fire points up, and mounting seeks<br>
His birth-place and his lasting seat, e'en thus<br>
Enters the captive soul into desire,<br>
Which is a spiritual motion, that ne'er rests<br>
Before enjoyment of the thing it loves.<br>
Enough to show thee, how the truth from those<br>
Is hidden, who aver all love a thing<br>
Praise-worthy in itself: although perhaps<br>
Its substance seem still good. &nbsp;Yet if the wax<br>
Be good, it follows not th' impression must."<br>
"What love is," I return'd, "thy words, O guide!<br>
And my own docile mind, reveal. &nbsp;Yet thence<br>
New doubts have sprung. &nbsp;For from without if love<br>
Be offer'd to us, and the spirit knows<br>
No other footing, tend she right or wrong,<br>
Is no desert of hers." &nbsp;He answering thus:<br>
"What reason here discovers I have power<br>
To show thee: that which lies beyond, expect<br>
From Beatrice, faith not reason's task.<br>
Spirit, substantial form, with matter join'd<br>
Not in confusion mix'd, hath in itself<br>
Specific virtue of that union born,<br>
Which is not felt except it work, nor prov'd<br>
But through effect, as vegetable life<br>
By the green leaf. &nbsp;From whence his intellect<br>
Deduced its primal notices of things,<br>
Man therefore knows not, or his appetites<br>
Their first affections; such in you, as zeal<br>
In bees to gather honey; at the first,<br>
Volition, meriting nor blame nor praise.<br>
But o'er each lower faculty supreme,<br>
That as she list are summon'd to her bar,<br>
Ye have that virtue in you, whose just voice<br>
Uttereth counsel, and whose word should keep<br>
The threshold of assent. &nbsp;Here is the source,<br>
Whence cause of merit in you is deriv'd,<br>
E'en as the affections good or ill she takes,<br>
Or severs, winnow'd as the chaff. &nbsp;Those men<br>
Who reas'ning went to depth profoundest, mark'd<br>
That innate freedom, and were thence induc'd<br>
To leave their moral teaching to the world.<br>
Grant then, that from necessity arise<br>
All love that glows within you; to dismiss<br>
Or harbour it, the pow'r is in yourselves.<br>
Remember, Beatrice, in her style,<br>
Denominates free choice by eminence<br>
The noble virtue, if in talk with thee<br>
She touch upon that theme." &nbsp;The moon, well nigh<br>
To midnight hour belated, made the stars<br>
Appear to wink and fade; and her broad disk<br>
Seem'd like a crag on fire, as up the vault<br>
That course she journey'd, which the sun then warms,<br>
When they of Rome behold him at his set.<br>
Betwixt Sardinia and the Corsic isle.<br>
And now the weight, that hung upon my thought,<br>
Was lighten'd by the aid of that clear spirit,<br>
Who raiseth Andes above Mantua's name.<br>
I therefore, when my questions had obtain'd<br>
Solution plain and ample, stood as one<br>
Musing in dreary slumber; but not long<br>
Slumber'd; for suddenly a multitude,<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/18-87.jpg"><img alt="18-87th.jpg (39K)" src="images/18-87th.jpg" height="472" width="435"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


The steep already turning, from behind,<br>
Rush'd on. &nbsp;With fury and like random rout,<br>
As echoing on their shores at midnight heard<br>
Ismenus and Asopus, for his Thebes<br>
If Bacchus' help were needed; so came these<br>
Tumultuous, curving each his rapid step,<br>
By eagerness impell'd of holy love.<br>
<br>Soon they o'ertook us; with such swiftness mov'd<br>
The mighty crowd. &nbsp;Two spirits at their head<br>
Cried weeping; "Blessed Mary sought with haste<br>
The hilly region. &nbsp;Caesar to subdue<br>
Ilerda, darted in Marseilles his sting,<br>
And flew to Spain."--"Oh tarry not: away;"<br>
The others shouted; "let not time be lost<br>
Through slackness of affection. &nbsp;Hearty zeal<br>
To serve reanimates celestial grace."<br>
<br>"O ye, in whom intenser fervency<br>
Haply supplies, where lukewarm erst ye fail'd,<br>
Slow or neglectful, to absolve your part<br>
Of good and virtuous, this man, who yet lives,<br>
(Credit my tale, though strange) desires t' ascend,<br>
So morning rise to light us. &nbsp;Therefore say<br>
Which hand leads nearest to the rifted rock?"<br>
<br>So spake my guide, to whom a shade return'd:<br>
"Come after us, and thou shalt find the cleft.<br>
We may not linger: such resistless will<br>
Speeds our unwearied course. &nbsp;Vouchsafe us then<br>
Thy pardon, if our duty seem to thee<br>
Discourteous rudeness. &nbsp;In Verona I<br>
Was abbot of San Zeno, when the hand<br>
Of Barbarossa grasp'd Imperial sway,<br>
That name, ne'er utter'd without tears in Milan.<br>
And there is he, hath one foot in his grave,<br>
Who for that monastery ere long shall weep,<br>
Ruing his power misus'd: for that his son,<br>
Of body ill compact, and worse in mind,<br>
And born in evil, he hath set in place<br>
Of its true pastor." &nbsp;Whether more he spake,<br>
Or here was mute, I know not: he had sped<br>
E'en now so far beyond us. &nbsp;Yet thus much<br>
I heard, and in rememb'rance treasur'd it.<br>
<br>He then, who never fail'd me at my need,<br>
Cried, "Hither turn. &nbsp;Lo! &nbsp;two with sharp remorse<br>
Chiding their sin!" &nbsp;In rear of all the troop<br>
These shouted: "First they died, to whom the sea<br>
Open'd, or ever Jordan saw his heirs:<br>
And they, who with Aeneas to the end<br>
Endur'd not suffering, for their portion chose<br>
Life without glory." &nbsp;Soon as they had fled<br>
Past reach of sight, new thought within me rose<br>
By others follow'd fast, and each unlike<br>
Its fellow: till led on from thought to thought,<br>
And pleasur'd with the fleeting train, mine eye<br>
Was clos'd, and meditation chang'd to dream.</p>
