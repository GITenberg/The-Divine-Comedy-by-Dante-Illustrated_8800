<h2>CANTO I</h2>
<br>

<p>
O'er better waves to speed her rapid course<br>
The light bark of my genius lifts the sail,<br>
Well pleas'd to leave so cruel sea behind;<br>
And of that second region will I sing,<br>
In which the human spirit from sinful blot<br>
Is purg'd, and for ascent to Heaven prepares.<br>
<br>Here, O ye hallow'd Nine! for in your train<br>
I follow, here the deadened strain revive;<br>
Nor let Calliope refuse to sound<br>
A somewhat higher song, of that loud tone,<br>
Which when the wretched birds of chattering note<br>
Had heard, they of forgiveness lost all hope.<br>
<br>Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread<br>
O'er the serene aspect of the pure air,<br>
High up as the first circle, to mine eyes<br>
Unwonted joy renew'd, soon as I 'scap'd<br>
Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom,<br>
That had mine eyes and bosom fill'd with grief.<br>
The radiant planet, that to love invites,<br>
Made all the orient laugh, and veil'd beneath<br>
The Pisces' light, that in his escort came.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/01-19.jpg"><img alt="01-19th.jpg (38K)" src="images/01-19th.jpg" height="477" width="432"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>To the right hand I turn'd, and fix'd my mind<br>
On the' other pole attentive, where I saw<br>
Four stars ne'er seen before save by the ken<br>
Of our first parents. &nbsp;Heaven of their rays<br>
Seem'd joyous. &nbsp;O thou northern site, bereft<br>
Indeed, and widow'd, since of these depriv'd!<br>
<br>As from this view I had desisted, straight<br>
Turning a little tow'rds the other pole,<br>
There from whence now the wain had disappear'd,<br>
I saw an old man standing by my side<br>
Alone, so worthy of rev'rence in his look,<br>
That ne'er from son to father more was ow'd.<br>
Low down his beard and mix'd with hoary white<br>
Descended, like his locks, which parting fell<br>
Upon his breast in double fold. &nbsp;The beams<br>
Of those four luminaries on his face<br>
So brightly shone, and with such radiance clear<br>
Deck'd it, that I beheld him as the sun.<br>
<br>"Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream,<br>
Forth from th' eternal prison-house have fled?"<br>
He spoke and moved those venerable plumes.<br>
"Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure<br>
Lights you emerging from the depth of night,<br>
That makes the infernal valley ever black?<br>
Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss<br>
Broken, or in high heaven new laws ordain'd,<br>
That thus, condemn'd, ye to my caves approach?"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/01-49.jpg"><img alt="01-49th.jpg (35K)" src="images/01-49th.jpg" height="477" width="430"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>My guide, then laying hold on me, by words<br>
And intimations given with hand and head,<br>
Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay<br>
Due reverence; then thus to him replied.<br>
<br>"Not of myself I come; a Dame from heaven<br>
Descending, had besought me in my charge<br>
To bring. &nbsp;But since thy will implies, that more<br>
Our true condition I unfold at large,<br>
Mine is not to deny thee thy request.<br>
This mortal ne'er hath seen the farthest gloom.<br>
But erring by his folly had approach'd<br>
So near, that little space was left to turn.<br>
Then, as before I told, I was dispatch'd<br>
To work his rescue, and no way remain'd<br>
Save this which I have ta'en. &nbsp;I have display'd<br>
Before him all the regions of the bad;<br>
And purpose now those spirits to display,<br>
That under thy command are purg'd from sin.<br>
How I have brought him would be long to say.<br>
From high descends the virtue, by whose aid<br>
I to thy sight and hearing him have led.<br>
Now may our coming please thee. &nbsp;In the search<br>
Of liberty he journeys: that how dear<br>
They know, who for her sake have life refus'd.<br>
Thou knowest, to whom death for her was sweet<br>
In Utica, where thou didst leave those weeds,<br>
That in the last great day will shine so bright.<br>
For us the' eternal edicts are unmov'd:<br>
He breathes, and I am free of Minos' power,<br>
Abiding in that circle where the eyes<br>
Of thy chaste Marcia beam, who still in look<br>
Prays thee, O hallow'd spirit! to own her shine.<br>
Then by her love we' implore thee, let us pass<br>
Through thy sev'n regions; for which best thanks<br>
I for thy favour will to her return,<br>
If mention there below thou not disdain."<br>
<br>"Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found,"<br>
He then to him rejoin'd, "while I was there,<br>
That all she ask'd me I was fain to grant.<br>
Now that beyond the' accursed stream she dwells,<br>
She may no longer move me, by that law,<br>
Which was ordain'd me, when I issued thence.<br>
Not so, if Dame from heaven, as thou sayst,<br>
Moves and directs thee; then no flattery needs.<br>
Enough for me that in her name thou ask.<br>
Go therefore now: and with a slender reed<br>
See that thou duly gird him, and his face<br>
Lave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence.<br>
For not with eye, by any cloud obscur'd,<br>
Would it be seemly before him to come,<br>
Who stands the foremost minister in heaven.<br>
This islet all around, there far beneath,<br>
Where the wave beats it, on the oozy bed<br>
Produces store of reeds. No other plant,<br>
Cover'd with leaves, or harden'd in its stalk,<br>
There lives, not bending to the water's sway.<br>
After, this way return not; but the sun<br>
Will show you, that now rises, where to take<br>
The mountain in its easiest ascent."<br>
<br>He disappear'd; and I myself uprais'd<br>
Speechless, and to my guide retiring close,<br>
Toward him turn'd mine eyes. &nbsp;He thus began;<br>
"My son! observant thou my steps pursue.<br>
We must retreat to rearward, for that way<br>
The champain to its low extreme declines."<br>
<br>The dawn had chas'd the matin hour of prime,<br>
Which deaf before it, so that from afar<br>
I spy'd the trembling of the ocean stream.<br>
<br>We travers'd the deserted plain, as one<br>
Who, wander'd from his track, thinks every step<br>
Trodden in vain till he regain the path.<br>
<br>When we had come, where yet the tender dew<br>
Strove with the sun, and in a place, where fresh<br>
The wind breath'd o'er it, while it slowly dried;<br>
Both hands extended on the watery grass<br>
My master plac'd, in graceful act and kind.<br>
Whence I of his intent before appriz'd,<br>
Stretch'd out to him my cheeks suffus'd with tears.<br>
There to my visage he anew restor'd<br>
That hue, which the dun shades of hell conceal'd.<br>
<br>Then on the solitary shore arriv'd,<br>
That never sailing on its waters saw<br>
Man, that could after measure back his course,<br>
He girt me in such manner as had pleas'd<br>
Him who instructed, and O, strange to tell!<br>
As he selected every humble plant,<br>
Wherever one was pluck'd, another there<br>
Resembling, straightway in its place arose.</p>

<h2>CANTO II</h2>
<br>

<p>Now had the sun to that horizon reach'd,<br>
That covers, with the most exalted point<br>
Of its meridian circle, Salem's walls,<br>
And night, that opposite to him her orb<br>
Sounds, from the stream of Ganges issued forth,<br>
Holding the scales, that from her hands are dropp'd<br>
When she reigns highest: so that where I was,<br>
Aurora's white and vermeil-tinctur'd cheek<br>
To orange turn'd as she in age increas'd.<br>
<br>Meanwhile we linger'd by the water's brink,<br>
Like men, who, musing on their road, in thought<br>
Journey, while motionless the body rests.<br>
When lo! as near upon the hour of dawn,<br>
Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam<br>
Glares down in west, over the ocean floor;<br>
So seem'd, what once again I hope to view,<br>
A light so swiftly coming through the sea,<br>
No winged course might equal its career.<br>
From which when for a space I had withdrawn<br>
Thine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide,<br>
Again I look'd and saw it grown in size<br>
And brightness: thou on either side appear'd<br>
Something, but what I knew not of bright hue,<br>
And by degrees from underneath it came<br>
Another. &nbsp;My preceptor silent yet<br>
Stood, while the brightness, that we first discern'd,<br>
Open'd the form of wings: then when he knew<br>
The pilot, cried aloud, "Down, down; bend low<br>
Thy knees; behold God's angel: fold thy hands:<br>
Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed."<br>



<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/02-27.jpg"><img alt="02-27th.jpg (33K)" src="images/02-27th.jpg" height="476" width="436"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Lo how all human means he sets at naught!<br>
So that nor oar he needs, nor other sail<br>
Except his wings, between such distant shores.<br>
Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear'd,<br>
Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,<br>
That not like mortal hairs fall off or change!"<br>
<br>As more and more toward us came, more bright<br>
Appear'd the bird of God, nor could the eye<br>
Endure his splendor near: I mine bent down.<br>
He drove ashore in a small bark so swift<br>
And light, that in its course no wave it drank.<br>
The heav'nly steersman at the prow was seen,<br>
Visibly written blessed in his looks.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/02-42.jpg"><img alt="02-42th.jpg (31K)" src="images/02-42th.jpg" height="477" width="427"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Within a hundred spirits and more there sat.<br>
"In Exitu Israel de Aegypto;"<br>
All with one voice together sang, with what<br>
In the remainder of that hymn is writ.<br>
Then soon as with the sign of holy cross<br>
He bless'd them, they at once leap'd out on land,<br>
The swiftly as he came return'd. The crew,<br>
There left, appear'd astounded with the place,<br>
Gazing around as one who sees new sights.<br>
<br>From every side the sun darted his beams,<br>
And with his arrowy radiance from mid heav'n<br>
Had chas'd the Capricorn, when that strange tribe<br>
Lifting their eyes towards us: "If ye know,<br>
Declare what path will Lead us to the mount."<br>
<br>Them Virgil answer'd. &nbsp;"Ye suppose perchance<br>
Us well acquainted with this place: but here,<br>
We, as yourselves, are strangers. &nbsp;Not long erst<br>
We came, before you but a little space,<br>
By other road so rough and hard, that now<br>
The' ascent will seem to us as play." &nbsp;The spirits,<br>
Who from my breathing had perceiv'd I liv'd,<br>
Grew pale with wonder. &nbsp;As the multitude<br>
Flock round a herald, sent with olive branch,<br>
To hear what news he brings, and in their haste<br>
Tread one another down, e'en so at sight<br>
Of me those happy spirits were fix'd, each one<br>
Forgetful of its errand, to depart,<br>
Where cleans'd from sin, it might be made all fair.<br>
<br>Then one I saw darting before the rest<br>
With such fond ardour to embrace me, I<br>
To do the like was mov'd. &nbsp;O shadows vain<br>
Except in outward semblance! thrice my hands<br>
I clasp'd behind it, they as oft return'd<br>
Empty into my breast again. &nbsp;Surprise<br>
I needs must think was painted in my looks,<br>
For that the shadow smil'd and backward drew.<br>
To follow it I hasten'd, but with voice<br>
Of sweetness it enjoin'd me to desist.<br>
Then who it was I knew, and pray'd of it,<br>
To talk with me, it would a little pause.<br>
It answered: "Thee as in my mortal frame<br>
I lov'd, so loos'd forth it I love thee still,<br>
And therefore pause; but why walkest thou here?"<br>
<br>"Not without purpose once more to return,<br>
Thou find'st me, my Casella, where I am<br>
Journeying this way;" I said, "but how of thee<br>
Hath so much time been lost?" &nbsp;He answer'd straight:<br>
"No outrage hath been done to me, if he<br>
Who when and whom he chooses takes, me oft<br>
This passage hath denied, since of just will<br>
His will he makes. &nbsp;These three months past indeed,<br>
He, whose chose to enter, with free leave<br>
Hath taken; whence I wand'ring by the shore<br>
Where Tyber's wave grows salt, of him gain'd kind<br>
Admittance, at that river's mouth, tow'rd which<br>
His wings are pointed, for there always throng<br>
All such as not to Archeron descend."<br>
<br>Then I: "If new laws have not quite destroy'd<br>
Memory and use of that sweet song of love,<br>
That while all my cares had power to 'swage;<br>
Please thee with it a little to console<br>
My spirit, that incumber'd with its frame,<br>
Travelling so far, of pain is overcome."<br>
<br>"Love that discourses in my thoughts." &nbsp;He then<br>
Began in such soft accents, that within<br>
The sweetness thrills me yet. &nbsp;My gentle guide<br>
And all who came with him, so well were pleas'd,<br>
That seem'd naught else might in their thoughts have room.<br>
<br>Fast fix'd in mute attention to his notes<br>
We stood, when lo! that old man venerable<br>
Exclaiming, "How is this, ye tardy spirits?<br>
What negligence detains you loit'ring here?<br>
Run to the mountain to cast off those scales,<br>
That from your eyes the sight of God conceal."<br>
<br>As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food<br>
Collected, blade or tares, without their pride<br>
Accustom'd, and in still and quiet sort,<br>
If aught alarm them, suddenly desert<br>
Their meal, assail'd by more important care;<br>
So I that new-come troop beheld, the song<br>
Deserting, hasten to the mountain's side,<br>
As one who goes yet where he tends knows not.<br>
<br>Nor with less hurried step did we depart.</p>


<br><br>

<h2>CANTO III</h2>
<br>


<p>Them sudden flight had scatter'd over the plain,<br>
Turn'd tow'rds the mountain, whither reason's voice<br>
Drives us; I to my faithful company<br>
Adhering, left it not. &nbsp;For how of him<br>
Depriv'd, might I have sped, or who beside<br>
Would o'er the mountainous tract have led my steps<br>
He with the bitter pang of self-remorse<br>
Seem'd smitten. &nbsp;O clear conscience and upright<br>
How doth a little fling wound thee sore!<br>
<br>Soon as his feet desisted (slack'ning pace),<br>
From haste, that mars all decency of act,<br>
My mind, that in itself before was wrapt,<br>
Its thoughts expanded, as with joy restor'd:<br>
And full against the steep ascent I set<br>
My face, where highest to heav'n its top o'erflows.<br>
<br>The sun, that flar'd behind, with ruddy beam<br>
Before my form was broken; for in me<br>
His rays resistance met. &nbsp;I turn'd aside<br>
With fear of being left, when I beheld<br>
Only before myself the ground obscur'd.<br>
When thus my solace, turning him around,<br>
Bespake me kindly: "Why distrustest thou?<br>
Believ'st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?<br>
It now is evening there, where buried lies<br>
The body, in which I cast a shade, remov'd<br>
To Naples from Brundusium's wall. &nbsp;Nor thou<br>
Marvel, if before me no shadow fall,<br>
More than that in the sky element<br>
One ray obstructs not other. &nbsp;To endure<br>
Torments of heat and cold extreme, like frames<br>
That virtue hath dispos'd, which how it works<br>
Wills not to us should be reveal'd. &nbsp;Insane<br>
Who hopes, our reason may that space explore,<br>
Which holds three persons in one substance knit.<br>
Seek not the wherefore, race of human kind;<br>
Could ye have seen the whole, no need had been<br>
For Mary to bring forth. &nbsp;Moreover ye<br>
Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly;<br>
To whose desires repose would have been giv'n,<br>
That now but serve them for eternal grief.<br>
I speak of Plato, and the Stagyrite,<br>
And others many more." &nbsp;And then he bent<br>
Downwards his forehead, and in troubled mood<br>
Broke off his speech. &nbsp;Meanwhile we had arriv'd<br>
Far as the mountain's foot, and there the rock<br>
Found of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps<br>
To climb it had been vain. &nbsp;The most remote<br>
Most wild untrodden path, in all the tract<br>
'Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this<br>
A ladder easy' and open of access.<br>
<br>"Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?"<br>
My master said and paus'd, "so that he may<br>
Ascend, who journeys without aid of wine?"<br>
And while with looks directed to the ground<br>
The meaning of the pathway he explor'd,<br>
And I gaz'd upward round the stony height,<br>
Of spirits, that toward us mov'd their steps,<br>
Yet moving seem'd not, they so slow approach'd.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/03-50.jpg"><img alt="03-50th.jpg (35K)" src="images/03-50th.jpg" height="476" width="428"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>I thus my guide address'd: "Upraise thine eyes,<br>
Lo that way some, of whom thou may'st obtain<br>
Counsel, if of thyself thou find'st it not!"<br>
<br>Straightway he look'd, and with free speech replied:<br>
"Let us tend thither: they but softly come.<br>
And thou be firm in hope, my son belov'd."<br>
<br>Now was that people distant far in space<br>
A thousand paces behind ours, as much<br>
As at a throw the nervous arm could fling,<br>
When all drew backward on the messy crags<br>
Of the steep bank, and firmly stood unmov'd<br>
As one who walks in doubt might stand to look.<br>
<br>"O spirits perfect!  O already chosen!"<br>
Virgil to them began, "by that blest peace,<br>
Which, as I deem, is for you all prepar'd,<br>
Instruct us where the mountain low declines,<br>
So that attempt to mount it be not vain.<br>
For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves."<br>
<br>As sheep, that step from forth their fold, by one,<br>
Or pairs, or three at once; meanwhile the rest<br>
Stand fearfully, bending the eye and nose<br>
To ground, and what the foremost does, that do<br>
The others, gath'ring round her, if she stops,<br>
Simple and quiet, nor the cause discern;<br>
So saw I moving to advance the first,<br>
Who of that fortunate crew were at the head,<br>
Of modest mien and graceful in their gait.<br>
When they before me had beheld the light<br>
From my right side fall broken on the ground,<br>
So that the shadow reach'd the cave, they stopp'd<br>
And somewhat back retir'd: the same did all,<br>
Who follow'd, though unweeting of the cause.<br>
<br>"Unask'd of you, yet freely I confess,<br>
This is a human body which ye see.<br>
That the sun's light is broken on the ground,<br>
Marvel not: but believe, that not without<br>
Virtue deriv'd from Heaven, we to climb<br>
Over this wall aspire." &nbsp;So them bespake<br>
My master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin'd;<br>
"Turn, and before you there the entrance lies,"<br>
Making a signal to us with bent hands.<br>
<br>Then of them one began. &nbsp;"Whoe'er thou art,<br>
Who journey'st thus this way, thy visage turn,<br>
Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen."<br>
<br>I tow'rds him turn'd, and with fix'd eye beheld.<br>
Comely, and fair, and gentle of aspect,<br>
He seem'd, but on one brow a gash was mark'd.<br>
<br>When humbly I disclaim'd to have beheld<br>
Him ever: "Now behold!" &nbsp;he said, and show'd<br>
High on his breast a wound: then smiling spake.<br>
<br>"I am Manfredi, grandson to the Queen<br>
Costanza: whence I pray thee, when return'd,<br>
To my fair daughter go, the parent glad<br>
Of Aragonia and Sicilia's pride;<br>
And of the truth inform her, if of me<br>
Aught else be told. &nbsp;When by two mortal blows<br>
My frame was shatter'd, I betook myself<br>
Weeping to him, who of free will forgives.<br>
My sins were horrible; but so wide arms<br>
Hath goodness infinite, that it receives<br>
All who turn to it. &nbsp;Had this text divine<br>
Been of Cosenza's shepherd better scann'd,<br>
Who then by Clement on my hunt was set,<br>
Yet at the bridge's head my bones had lain,<br>
Near Benevento, by the heavy mole<br>
Protected; but the rain now drenches them,<br>
And the wind drives, out of the kingdom's bounds,<br>
Far as the stream of Verde, where, with lights<br>
Extinguish'd, he remov'd them from their bed.<br>
Yet by their curse we are not so destroy'd,<br>
But that the eternal love may turn, while hope<br>
Retains her verdant blossoms. &nbsp;True it is,<br>
That such one as in contumacy dies<br>
Against the holy church, though he repent,<br>
Must wander thirty-fold for all the time<br>
In his presumption past; if such decree<br>
Be not by prayers of good men shorter made<br>
Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss;<br>
Revealing to my good Costanza, how<br>
Thou hast beheld me, and beside the terms<br>
Laid on me of that interdict; for here<br>
By means of those below much profit comes."</p>

<h2>CANTO IV</h2>
<br>

<p>When by sensations of delight or pain,<br>
That any of our faculties hath seiz'd,<br>
Entire the soul collects herself, it seems<br>
She is intent upon that power alone,<br>
And thus the error is disprov'd which holds<br>
The soul not singly lighted in the breast.<br>
And therefore when as aught is heard or seen,<br>
That firmly keeps the soul toward it turn'd,<br>
Time passes, and a man perceives it not.<br>
For that, whereby he hearken, is one power,<br>
Another that, which the whole spirit hash;<br>
This is as it were bound, while that is free.<br>
<br>This found I true by proof, hearing that spirit<br>
And wond'ring; for full fifty steps aloft<br>
The sun had measur'd unobserv'd of me,<br>
When we arriv'd where all with one accord<br>
The spirits shouted, "Here is what ye ask."<br>
<br>A larger aperture ofttimes is stopp'd<br>
With forked stake of thorn by villager,<br>
When the ripe grape imbrowns, than was the path,<br>
By which my guide, and I behind him close,<br>
Ascended solitary, when that troop<br>
Departing left us. &nbsp;On Sanleo's road<br>
Who journeys, or to Noli low descends,<br>
Or mounts Bismantua's height, must use his feet;<br>
But here a man had need to fly, I mean<br>
With the swift wing and plumes of high desire,<br>
Conducted by his aid, who gave me hope,<br>
And with light furnish'd to direct my way.<br>

<br><br><br><br>


<br>We through the broken rock ascended, close<br>
Pent on each side, while underneath the ground<br>
Ask'd help of hands and feet. &nbsp;When we arriv'd<br>
Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank,<br>
Where the plain level open'd I exclaim'd,<br>
"O master! say which way can we proceed?"<br>
<br>He answer'd, "Let no step of thine recede.<br>
Behind me gain the mountain, till to us<br>
Some practis'd guide appear." &nbsp;That eminence<br>
Was lofty that no eye might reach its point,<br>
And the side proudly rising, more than line<br>
From the mid quadrant to the centre drawn.<br>
I wearied thus began: "Parent belov'd!<br>
Turn, and behold how I remain alone,<br>
If thou stay not."&mdash;"My son!" &nbsp;He straight reply'd,<br>
"Thus far put forth thy strength;" and to a track<br>
Pointed, that, on this side projecting, round<br>
Circles the hill. &nbsp;His words so spurr'd me on,<br>
That I behind him clamb'ring, forc'd myself,<br>
Till my feet press'd the circuit plain beneath.<br>
There both together seated, turn'd we round<br>
To eastward, whence was our ascent: and oft<br>
Many beside have with delight look'd back.<br>
<br>First on the nether shores I turn'd my eyes,<br>
Then rais'd them to the sun, and wond'ring mark'd<br>
That from the left it smote us. &nbsp;Soon perceiv'd<br>
That Poet sage now at the car of light<br>
Amaz'd I stood, where 'twixt us and the north<br>
Its course it enter'd. &nbsp;Whence he thus to me:<br>
"Were Leda's offspring now in company<br>
Of that broad mirror, that high up and low<br>
Imparts his light beneath, thou might'st behold<br>
The ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears<br>
Wheel, if its ancient course it not forsook.<br>
How that may be if thou would'st think; within<br>
Pond'ring, imagine Sion with this mount<br>
Plac'd on the earth, so that to both be one<br>
Horizon, and two hemispheres apart,<br>
Where lies the path that Phaeton ill knew<br>
To guide his erring chariot: thou wilt see<br>
How of necessity by this on one<br>
He passes, while by that on the' other side,<br>
If with clear view shine intellect attend."<br>
<br>"Of truth, kind teacher!" &nbsp;I exclaim'd, "so clear<br>
Aught saw I never, as I now discern<br>
Where seem'd my ken to fail, that the mid orb<br>
Of the supernal motion (which in terms<br>
Of art is called the Equator, and remains<br>
Ever between the sun and winter) for the cause<br>
Thou hast assign'd, from hence toward the north<br>
Departs, when those who in the Hebrew land<br>
Inhabit, see it tow'rds the warmer part.<br>
But if it please thee, I would gladly know,<br>
How far we have to journey: for the hill<br>
Mounts higher, than this sight of mine can mount."<br>
<br>He thus to me: "Such is this steep ascent,<br>
That it is ever difficult at first,<br>
But, more a man proceeds, less evil grows.<br>
When pleasant it shall seem to thee, so much<br>
That upward going shall be easy to thee.<br>
As in a vessel to go down the tide,<br>
Then of this path thou wilt have reach'd the end.<br>
There hope to rest thee from thy toil. &nbsp;No more<br>
I answer, and thus far for certain know."<br>
As he his words had spoken, near to us<br>
A voice there sounded: "Yet ye first perchance<br>
May to repose you by constraint be led."<br>
At sound thereof each turn'd, and on the left<br>
A huge stone we beheld, of which nor I<br>
Nor he before was ware. &nbsp;Thither we drew,<br>
find there were some, who in the shady place<br>
Behind the rock were standing, as a man<br>
Thru' idleness might stand. &nbsp;Among them one,<br>
Who seem'd to me much wearied, sat him down,<br>
And with his arms did fold his knees about,<br>
Holding his face between them downward bent.<br>

<br><br><br><br>


<br>"Sweet Sir!" &nbsp;I cry'd, "behold that man, who shows<br>
Himself more idle, than if laziness<br>
Were sister to him." &nbsp;Straight he turn'd to us,<br>
And, o'er the thigh lifting his face, observ'd,<br>
Then in these accents spake: "Up then, proceed<br>
Thou valiant one." &nbsp;Straight who it was I knew;<br>
Nor could the pain I felt (for want of breath<br>
Still somewhat urg'd me) hinder my approach.<br>
And when I came to him, he scarce his head<br>
Uplifted, saying "Well hast thou discern'd,<br>
How from the left the sun his chariot leads."<br>
<br>His lazy acts and broken words my lips<br>
To laughter somewhat mov'd; when I began:<br>
"Belacqua, now for thee I grieve no more.<br>
But tell, why thou art seated upright there?<br>
Waitest thou escort to conduct thee hence?<br>
Or blame I only shine accustom'd ways?"<br>
Then he: "My brother, of what use to mount,<br>
When to my suffering would not let me pass<br>
The bird of God, who at the portal sits?<br>
Behooves so long that heav'n first bear me round<br>
Without its limits, as in life it bore,<br>
Because I to the end repentant Sighs<br>
Delay'd, if prayer do not aid me first,<br>
That riseth up from heart which lives in grace.<br>
What other kind avails, not heard in heaven?"'<br>
<br>Before me now the Poet up the mount<br>
Ascending, cried: "Haste thee, for see the sun<br>
Has touch'd the point meridian, and the night<br>
Now covers with her foot Marocco's shore."</p>
