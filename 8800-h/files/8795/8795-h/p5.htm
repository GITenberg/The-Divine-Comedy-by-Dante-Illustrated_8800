<h2>CANTO XXVI</h2>
<br>

<p>While singly thus along the rim we walk'd,<br>
Oft the good master warn'd me: "Look thou well.<br>
Avail it that I caution thee." &nbsp;The sun<br>
Now all the western clime irradiate chang'd<br>
From azure tinct to white; and, as I pass'd,<br>
My passing shadow made the umber'd flame<br>
Burn ruddier. &nbsp;At so strange a sight I mark'd<br>
That many a spirit marvel'd on his way.<br>
<br>This bred occasion first to speak of me,<br>
"He seems," said they, "no insubstantial frame:"<br>
Then to obtain what certainty they might,<br>
Stretch'd towards me, careful not to overpass<br>
The burning pale. &nbsp;"O thou, who followest<br>
The others, haply not more slow than they,<br>
But mov'd by rev'rence, answer me, who burn<br>
In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these<br>
All for thine answer do more thirst, than doth<br>
Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream.<br>
Tell us, how is it that thou mak'st thyself<br>
A wall against the sun, as thou not yet<br>
Into th' inextricable toils of death<br>
Hadst enter'd?" &nbsp;Thus spake one, and I had straight<br>
Declar'd me, if attention had not turn'd<br>
To new appearance. &nbsp;Meeting these, there came,<br>
Midway the burning path, a crowd, on whom<br>
Earnestly gazing, from each part I view<br>
The shadows all press forward, sev'rally<br>
Each snatch a hasty kiss, and then away.<br>
E'en so the emmets, 'mid their dusky troops,<br>
Peer closely one at other, to spy out<br>
Their mutual road perchance, and how they thrive.<br>
<br>That friendly greeting parted, ere dispatch<br>
Of the first onward step, from either tribe<br>
Loud clamour rises: those, who newly come,<br>
Shout &nbsp;"Sodom and Gomorrah!" these, "The cow<br>
Pasiphae enter'd, that the beast she woo'd<br>
Might rush unto her luxury." &nbsp;Then as cranes,<br>
That part towards the Riphaean mountains fly,<br>
Part towards the Lybic sands, these to avoid<br>
The ice, and those the sun; so hasteth off<br>
One crowd, advances th' other; and resume<br>
Their first song weeping, and their several shout.<br>
<br>Again drew near my side the very same,<br>
Who had erewhile besought me, and their looks<br>
Mark'd eagerness to listen. &nbsp;I, who twice<br>
Their will had noted, spake: "O spirits secure,<br>
Whene'er the time may be, of peaceful end!<br>
My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age,<br>
Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed<br>
With blood, and sinew-strung. &nbsp;That I no more<br>
May live in blindness, hence I tend aloft.<br>
There is a dame on high, who wind for us<br>
This grace, by which my mortal through your realm<br>
I bear. &nbsp;But may your utmost wish soon meet<br>
Such full fruition, that the orb of heaven,<br>
Fullest of love, and of most ample space,<br>
Receive you, as ye tell (upon my page<br>
Henceforth to stand recorded) who ye are,<br>
And what this multitude, that at your backs<br>
Have past behind us." &nbsp;As one, mountain-bred,<br>
Rugged and clownish, if some city's walls<br>
He chance to enter, round him stares agape,<br>
Confounded and struck dumb; e'en such appear'd<br>
Each spirit. &nbsp;But when rid of that amaze,<br>
(Not long the inmate of a noble heart)<br>
He, who before had question'd, thus resum'd:<br>
"O blessed, who, for death preparing, tak'st<br>
Experience of our limits, in thy bark!<br>
Their crime, who not with us proceed, was that,<br>
For which, as he did triumph, Caesar heard<br>
The snout of 'queen,' to taunt him. &nbsp;Hence their cry<br>
Of 'Sodom,' as they parted, to rebuke<br>
Themselves, and aid the burning by their shame.<br>
Our sinning was Hermaphrodite: but we,<br>
Because the law of human kind we broke,<br>
Following like beasts our vile concupiscence,<br>
Hence parting from them, to our own disgrace<br>
Record the name of her, by whom the beast<br>
In bestial tire was acted. &nbsp;Now our deeds<br>
Thou know'st, and how we sinn'd. &nbsp;If thou by name<br>
Wouldst haply know us, time permits not now<br>
To tell so much, nor can I. &nbsp;Of myself<br>
Learn what thou wishest. &nbsp;Guinicelli I,<br>
Who having truly sorrow'd ere my last,<br>
Already cleanse me." &nbsp;With such pious joy,<br>
As the two sons upon their mother gaz'd<br>
From sad Lycurgus rescu'd, such my joy<br>
(Save that I more represt it) when I heard<br>
From his own lips the name of him pronounc'd,<br>
Who was a father to me, and to those<br>
My betters, who have ever us'd the sweet<br>
And pleasant rhymes of love. &nbsp;So nought I heard<br>
Nor spake, but long time thoughtfully I went,<br>
Gazing on him; and, only for the fire,<br>
Approach'd not nearer. &nbsp;When my eyes were fed<br>
By looking on him, with such solemn pledge,<br>
As forces credence, I devoted me<br>
Unto his service wholly. &nbsp;In reply<br>
He thus bespake me: "What from thee I hear<br>
Is grav'd so deeply on my mind, the waves<br>
Of Lethe shall not wash it off, nor make<br>
A whit less lively. &nbsp;But as now thy oath<br>
Has seal'd the truth, declare what cause impels<br>
That love, which both thy looks and speech bewray."<br>
<br>"Those dulcet lays," I answer'd, "which, as long<br>
As of our tongue the beauty does not fade,<br>
Shall make us love the very ink that trac'd them."<br>
<br>"Brother!" &nbsp;he cried, and pointed at a shade<br>
Before him, "there is one, whose mother speech<br>
Doth owe to him a fairer ornament.<br>
He in love ditties and the tales of prose<br>
Without a rival stands, and lets the fools<br>
Talk on, who think the songster of Limoges<br>
O'ertops him. &nbsp;Rumour and the popular voice<br>
They look to more than truth, and so confirm<br>
Opinion, ere by art or reason taught.<br>
Thus many of the elder time cried up<br>
Guittone, giving him the prize, till truth<br>
By strength of numbers vanquish'd. &nbsp;If thou own<br>
So ample privilege, as to have gain'd<br>
Free entrance to the cloister, whereof Christ<br>
Is Abbot of the college, say to him<br>
One paternoster for me, far as needs<br>
For dwellers in this world, where power to sin<br>
No longer tempts us." &nbsp;Haply to make way<br>
For one, that follow'd next, when that was said,<br>
He vanish'd through the fire, as through the wave<br>
A fish, that glances diving to the deep.<br>
<br>I, to the spirit he had shown me, drew<br>
A little onward, and besought his name,<br>
For which my heart, I said, kept gracious room.<br>
He frankly thus began: "Thy courtesy<br>
So wins on me, I have nor power nor will<br>
To hide me. &nbsp;I am Arnault; and with songs,<br>
Sorely lamenting for my folly past,<br>
Thorough this ford of fire I wade, and see<br>
The day, I hope for, smiling in my view.<br>
I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up<br>
Unto the summit of the scale, in time<br>
Remember ye my suff'rings." &nbsp;With such words<br>
He disappear'd in the refining flame.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXVII</h2>
<br>

<p>Now was the sun so station'd, as when first<br>
His early radiance quivers on the heights,<br>
Where stream'd his Maker's blood, while Libra hangs<br>
Above Hesperian Ebro, and new fires<br>
Meridian flash on Ganges' yellow tide.<br>
<br>So day was sinking, when the' angel of God<br>
Appear'd before us. &nbsp;Joy was in his mien.<br>
Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink,<br>
And with a voice, whose lively clearness far<br>
Surpass'd our human, "Blessed are the pure<br>
In heart," he Sang: then near him as we came,<br>
"Go ye not further, holy spirits!" &nbsp;he cried,<br>
"Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list<br>
Attentive to the song ye hear from thence."<br>
<br>I, when I heard his saying, was as one<br>
Laid in the grave. &nbsp;My hands together clasp'd,<br>
And upward stretching, on the fire I look'd,<br>
And busy fancy conjur'd up the forms<br>
Erewhile beheld alive consum'd in flames.<br>
<br>Th' escorting spirits turn'd with gentle looks<br>
Toward me, and the Mantuan spake: "My son,<br>
Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death.<br>
Remember thee, remember thee, if I<br>
Safe e'en on Geryon brought thee: now I come<br>
More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?<br>
Of this be sure: though in its womb that flame<br>
A thousand years contain'd thee, from thy head<br>
No hair should perish. &nbsp;If thou doubt my truth,<br>
Approach, and with thy hands thy vesture's hem<br>
Stretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief.<br>
Lay now all fear, O lay all fear aside.<br>
Turn hither, and come onward undismay'd."<br>
I still, though conscience urg'd' no step advanc'd.<br>
<br>When still he saw me fix'd and obstinate,<br>
Somewhat disturb'd he cried: "Mark now, my son,<br>
From Beatrice thou art by this wall<br>
Divided." &nbsp;As at Thisbe's name the eye<br>
Of Pyramus was open'd (when life ebb'd<br>
Fast from his veins), and took one parting glance,<br>
While vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turn'd<br>
To my sage guide, relenting, when I heard<br>
The name, that springs forever in my breast.<br>
<br>He shook his forehead; and, "How long," he said,<br>
"Linger we now?" &nbsp;then smil'd, as one would smile<br>
Upon a child, that eyes the fruit and yields.<br>
Into the fire before me then he walk'd;<br>
And Statius, who erewhile no little space<br>
Had parted us, he pray'd to come behind.<br>
<br>I would have cast me into molten glass<br>
To cool me, when I enter'd; so intense<br>
Rag'd the conflagrant mass. &nbsp;The sire belov'd,<br>
To comfort me, as he proceeded, still<br>
Of Beatrice talk'd. &nbsp;"Her eyes," saith he,<br>
"E'en now I seem to view." &nbsp;From the other side<br>
A voice, that sang, did guide us, and the voice<br>
Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth,<br>
There where the path led upward. &nbsp;"Come," we heard,<br>
"Come, blessed of my Father." &nbsp;Such the sounds,<br>
That hail'd us from within a light, which shone<br>
So radiant, I could not endure the view.<br>
"The sun," it added, "hastes: and evening comes.<br>
Delay not: ere the western sky is hung<br>
With blackness, strive ye for the pass." &nbsp;Our way<br>
Upright within the rock arose, and fac'd<br>
Such part of heav'n, that from before my steps<br>
The beams were shrouded of the sinking sun.<br>
<br>Nor many stairs were overpass, when now<br>
By fading of the shadow we perceiv'd<br>
The sun behind us couch'd: and ere one face<br>
Of darkness o'er its measureless expanse<br>
Involv'd th' horizon, and the night her lot<br>
Held individual, each of us had made<br>
A stair his pallet: not that will, but power,<br>
Had fail'd us, by the nature of that mount<br>
Forbidden further travel. &nbsp;As the goats,<br>
That late have skipp'd and wanton'd rapidly<br>
Upon the craggy cliffs, ere they had ta'en<br>
Their supper on the herb, now silent lie<br>
And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown,<br>
While noonday rages; and the goatherd leans<br>
Upon his staff, and leaning watches them:<br>
And as the swain, that lodges out all night<br>
In quiet by his flock, lest beast of prey<br>
Disperse them; even so all three abode,<br>
I as a goat and as the shepherds they,<br>
Close pent on either side by shelving rock.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/27-97.jpg"><img alt="27-97th.jpg (40K)" src="images/27-97th.jpg" height="456" width="433"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>A little glimpse of sky was seen above;<br>
Yet by that little I beheld the stars<br>
In magnitude and rustle shining forth<br>
With more than wonted glory. &nbsp;As I lay,<br>
Gazing on them, and in that fit of musing,<br>
Sleep overcame me, sleep, that bringeth oft<br>
Tidings of future hap. &nbsp;About the hour,<br>
As I believe, when Venus from the east<br>
First lighten'd on the mountain, she whose orb<br>
Seems always glowing with the fire of love,<br>
A lady young and beautiful, I dream'd,<br>
Was passing o'er a lea; and, as she came,<br>
Methought I saw her ever and anon<br>
Bending to cull the flowers; and thus she sang:<br>
"Know ye, whoever of my name would ask,<br>
That I am Leah: for my brow to weave<br>
A garland, these fair hands unwearied ply.<br>
To please me at the crystal mirror, here<br>
I deck me. &nbsp;But my sister Rachel, she<br>
Before her glass abides the livelong day,<br>
Her radiant eyes beholding, charm'd no less,<br>
Than I with this delightful task. &nbsp;Her joy<br>
In contemplation, as in labour mine."<br>
<br>And now as glimm'ring dawn appear'd, that breaks<br>
More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he<br>
Sojourns less distant on his homeward way,<br>
Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled<br>
My slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide<br>
Already risen. &nbsp;"That delicious fruit,<br>
Which through so many a branch the zealous care<br>
Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day<br>
Appease thy hunger." &nbsp;Such the words I heard<br>
From Virgil's lip; and never greeting heard<br>
So pleasant as the sounds. &nbsp;Within me straight<br>
Desire so grew upon desire to mount,<br>
Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings<br>
Increasing for my flight. &nbsp;When we had run<br>
O'er all the ladder to its topmost round,<br>
As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix'd<br>
His eyes, and thus he spake: "Both fires, my son,<br>
The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,<br>
And art arriv'd, where of itself my ken<br>
No further reaches. &nbsp;I with skill and art<br>
Thus far have drawn thee. &nbsp;Now thy pleasure take<br>
For guide. &nbsp;Thou hast o'ercome the steeper way,<br>
O'ercome the straighter. &nbsp;Lo! the sun, that darts<br>
His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb,<br>
The arboreta and flowers, which of itself<br>
This land pours forth profuse!  Till those bright eyes<br>
With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste<br>
To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,<br>
Or wander where thou wilt. &nbsp;Expect no more<br>
Sanction of warning voice or sign from me,<br>
Free of thy own arbitrement to choose,<br>
Discreet, judicious. &nbsp;To distrust thy sense<br>
Were henceforth error. &nbsp;I invest thee then<br>
With crown and mitre, sovereign o'er thyself."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="28"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXVIII</h2>
<br>

<p>Through that celestial forest, whose thick shade<br>
With lively greenness the new-springing day<br>
Attemper'd, eager now to roam, and search<br>
Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank,<br>
Along the champain leisurely my way<br>
Pursuing, o'er the ground, that on all sides<br>
Delicious odour breath'd. &nbsp;A pleasant air,<br>
That intermitted never, never veer'd,<br>
Smote on my temples, gently, as a wind<br>
Of softest influence: at which the sprays,<br>
Obedient all, lean'd trembling to that part<br>
Where first the holy mountain casts his shade,<br>
Yet were not so disorder'd, but that still<br>
Upon their top the feather'd quiristers<br>
Applied their wonted art, and with full joy<br>
Welcom'd those hours of prime, and warbled shrill<br>
Amid the leaves, that to their jocund lays<br>
inept tenor; even as from branch to branch,<br>
Along the piney forests on the shore<br>
Of Chiassi, rolls the gath'ring melody,<br>
When Eolus hath from his cavern loos'd<br>
The dripping south. &nbsp;Already had my steps,<br>
Though slow, so far into that ancient wood<br>
Transported me, I could not ken the place<br>
Where I had enter'd, when behold! my path<br>
Was bounded by a rill, which to the left<br>
With little rippling waters bent the grass,<br>
That issued from its brink. &nbsp;On earth no wave<br>
How clean soe'er, that would not seem to have<br>
Some mixture in itself, compar'd with this,<br>
Transpicuous, clear; yet darkly on it roll'd,<br>
Darkly beneath perpetual gloom, which ne'er<br>
Admits or sun or moon light there to shine.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/28-22.jpg"><img alt="28-22th.jpg (30K)" src="images/28-22th.jpg" height="476" width="432"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>My feet advanc'd not; but my wond'ring eyes<br>
Pass'd onward, o'er the streamlet, to survey<br>
The tender May-bloom, flush'd through many a hue,<br>
In prodigal variety: and there,<br>
As object, rising suddenly to view,<br>
That from our bosom every thought beside<br>
With the rare marvel chases, I beheld<br>
A lady all alone, who, singing, went,<br>
And culling flower from flower, wherewith her way<br>
Was all o'er painted. &nbsp;"Lady beautiful!<br>
Thou, who (if looks, that use to speak the heart,<br>
Are worthy of our trust), with love's own beam<br>
Dost warm thee," thus to her my speech I fram'd:<br>
"Ah! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend<br>
Thy steps so near, that I may list thy song.<br>
Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks,<br>
I call to mind where wander'd and how look'd<br>
Proserpine, in that season, when her child<br>
The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring."<br>
<br>As when a lady, turning in the dance,<br>
Doth foot it featly, and advances scarce<br>
One step before the other to the ground;<br>
Over the yellow and vermilion flowers<br>
Thus turn'd she at my suit, most maiden-like,<br>
Valing her sober eyes, and came so near,<br>
That I distinctly caught the dulcet sound.<br>
Arriving where the limped waters now<br>
Lav'd the green sward, her eyes she deign'd to raise,<br>
That shot such splendour on me, as I ween<br>
Ne'er glanced from Cytherea's, when her son<br>
Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart.<br>
Upon the opposite bank she stood and smil'd<br>
through her graceful fingers shifted still<br>
The intermingling dyes, which without seed<br>
That lofty land unbosoms. &nbsp;By the stream<br>
Three paces only were we sunder'd: yet<br>
The Hellespont, where Xerxes pass'd it o'er,<br>
(A curb for ever to the pride of man)<br>
Was by Leander not more hateful held<br>
For floating, with inhospitable wave<br>
'Twixt Sestus and Abydos, than by me<br>
That flood, because it gave no passage thence.<br>
<br>"Strangers ye come, and haply in this place,<br>
That cradled human nature in its birth,<br>
Wond'ring, ye not without suspicion view<br>
My smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody,<br>
'Thou, Lord! hast made me glad,' will give ye light,<br>
Which may uncloud your minds. &nbsp;And thou, who stand'st<br>
The foremost, and didst make thy suit to me,<br>
Say if aught else thou wish to hear: for I<br>
Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine."<br>
<br>She spake; and I replied: "I know not how<br>
To reconcile this wave and rustling sound<br>
Of forest leaves, with what I late have heard<br>
Of opposite report." &nbsp;She answering thus:<br>
"I will unfold the cause, whence that proceeds,<br>
Which makes thee wonder; and so purge the cloud<br>
That hath enwraps thee. &nbsp;The First Good, whose joy<br>
Is only in himself, created man<br>
For happiness, and gave this goodly place,<br>
His pledge and earnest of eternal peace.<br>
Favour'd thus highly, through his own defect<br>
He fell, and here made short sojourn; he fell,<br>
And, for the bitterness of sorrow, chang'd<br>
Laughter unblam'd and ever-new delight.<br>
That vapours none, exhal'd from earth beneath,<br>
Or from the waters (which, wherever heat<br>
Attracts them, follow), might ascend thus far<br>
To vex man's peaceful state, this mountain rose<br>
So high toward the heav'n, nor fears the rage<br>
Of elements contending, from that part<br>
Exempted, where the gate his limit bars.<br>
Because the circumambient air throughout<br>
With its first impulse circles still, unless<br>
Aught interpose to cheek or thwart its course;<br>
Upon the summit, which on every side<br>
To visitation of th' impassive air<br>
Is open, doth that motion strike, and makes<br>
Beneath its sway th' umbrageous wood resound:<br>
And in the shaken plant such power resides,<br>
That it impregnates with its efficacy<br>
The voyaging breeze, upon whose subtle plume<br>
That wafted flies abroad; and th' other land<br>
Receiving (as 't is worthy in itself,<br>
Or in the clime, that warms it), doth conceive,<br>
And from its womb produces many a tree<br>
Of various virtue. &nbsp;This when thou hast heard,<br>
The marvel ceases, if in yonder earth<br>
Some plant without apparent seed be found<br>
To fix its fibrous stem. &nbsp;And further learn,<br>
That with prolific foison of all seeds,<br>
This holy plain is fill'd, and in itself<br>
Bears fruit that ne'er was pluck'd on other soil.<br>
&nbsp;The water, thou behold'st, springs not from vein,<br>
As stream, that intermittently repairs<br>
And spends his pulse of life, but issues forth<br>
From fountain, solid, undecaying, sure;<br>
And by the will omnific, full supply<br>
Feeds whatsoe'er On either side it pours;<br>
On this devolv'd with power to take away<br>
Remembrance of offence, on that to bring<br>
Remembrance back of every good deed done.<br>
From whence its name of Lethe on this part;<br>
On th' other Eunoe: both of which must first<br>
Be tasted ere it work; the last exceeding<br>
All flavours else. &nbsp;Albeit thy thirst may now<br>
Be well contented, if I here break off,<br>
No more revealing: yet a corollary<br>
I freely give beside: nor deem my words<br>
Less grateful to thee, if they somewhat pass<br>
The stretch of promise. &nbsp;They, whose verse of yore<br>
The golden age recorded and its bliss,<br>
On the Parnassian mountain, of this place<br>
Perhaps had dream'd. &nbsp;Here was man guiltless, here<br>
Perpetual spring and every fruit, and this<br>
The far-fam'd nectar." &nbsp;Turning to the bards,<br>
When she had ceas'd, I noted in their looks<br>
A smile at her conclusion; then my face<br>
Again directed to the lovely dame.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXIX</h2>
<br>

<p>Singing, as if enamour'd, she resum'd<br>
And clos'd the song, with "Blessed they whose sins<br>
Are cover'd." &nbsp;Like the wood-nymphs then, that tripp'd<br>
Singly across the sylvan shadows, one<br>
Eager to view and one to 'scape the sun,<br>
So mov'd she on, against the current, up<br>
The verdant rivage. &nbsp;I, her mincing step<br>
Observing, with as tardy step pursued.<br>
<br>Between us not an hundred paces trod,<br>
The bank, on each side bending equally,<br>
Gave me to face the orient. &nbsp;Nor our way<br>
Far onward brought us, when to me at once<br>
She turn'd, and cried: "My brother! look and hearken."<br>
And lo! a sudden lustre ran across<br>
Through the great forest on all parts, so bright<br>
I doubted whether lightning were abroad;<br>
But that expiring ever in the spleen,<br>
That doth unfold it, and this during still<br>
And waxing still in splendor, made me question<br>
What it might be: and a sweet melody<br>
Ran through the luminous air. &nbsp;Then did I chide<br>
With warrantable zeal the hardihood<br>
Of our first parent, for that there were earth<br>
Stood in obedience to the heav'ns, she only,<br>
Woman, the creature of an hour, endur'd not<br>
Restraint of any veil: which had she borne<br>
Devoutly, joys, ineffable as these,<br>
Had from the first, and long time since, been mine.<br>
<br>While through that wilderness of primy sweets<br>
That never fade, suspense I walk'd, and yet<br>
Expectant of beatitude more high,<br>
Before us, like a blazing fire, the air<br>
Under the green boughs glow'd; and, for a song,<br>
Distinct the sound of melody was heard.<br>
<br>O ye thrice holy virgins! for your sakes<br>
If e'er I suffer'd hunger, cold and watching,<br>
Occasion calls on me to crave your bounty.<br>
Now through my breast let Helicon his stream<br>
Pour copious; and Urania with her choir<br>
Arise to aid me: while the verse unfolds<br>
Things that do almost mock the grasp of thought.<br>
<br>Onward a space, what seem'd seven trees of gold,<br>
The intervening distance to mine eye<br>
Falsely presented; but when I was come<br>
So near them, that no lineament was lost<br>
Of those, with which a doubtful object, seen<br>
Remotely, plays on the misdeeming sense,<br>
Then did the faculty, that ministers<br>
Discourse to reason, these for tapers of gold<br>
Distinguish, and it th' singing trace the sound<br>
"Hosanna." &nbsp;Above, their beauteous garniture<br>
Flam'd with more ample lustre, than the moon<br>
Through cloudless sky at midnight in her full.<br>
<br>I turn'd me full of wonder to my guide;<br>
And he did answer with a countenance<br>
Charg'd with no less amazement: whence my view<br>
Reverted to those lofty things, which came<br>
So slowly moving towards us, that the bride<br>
Would have outstript them on her bridal day.<br>
<br>The lady called aloud: "Why thus yet burns<br>
Affection in thee for these living, lights,<br>
And dost not look on that which follows them?"<br>
<br>I straightway mark'd a tribe behind them walk,<br>
As if attendant on their leaders, cloth'd<br>
With raiment of such whiteness, as on earth<br>
Was never. &nbsp;On my left, the wat'ry gleam<br>
Borrow'd, and gave me back, when there I look'd.<br>
As in a mirror, my left side portray'd.<br>
<br>When I had chosen on the river's edge<br>
Such station, that the distance of the stream<br>
Alone did separate me; there I stay'd<br>
My steps for clearer prospect, and beheld<br>
The flames go onward, leaving, as they went,<br>
The air behind them painted as with trail<br>
Of liveliest pencils! so distinct were mark'd<br>
All those sev'n listed colours, whence the sun<br>
Maketh his bow, and Cynthia her zone.<br>
These streaming gonfalons did flow beyond<br>
My vision; and ten paces, as I guess,<br>
Parted the outermost. &nbsp;Beneath a sky<br>
So beautiful, came foul and-twenty elders,<br>
By two and two, with flower-de-luces crown'd.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/29-80.jpg"><img alt="29-80th.jpg (36K)" src="images/29-80th.jpg" height="472" width="435"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


All sang one song: "Blessed be thou among<br>
The daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness<br>
Blessed for ever!" &nbsp;After that the flowers,<br>
And the fresh herblets, on the opposite brink,<br>
Were free from that elected race; as light<br>
In heav'n doth second light, came after them<br>
Four animals, each crown'd with verdurous leaf.<br>
With six wings each was plum'd, the plumage full<br>
Of eyes, and th' eyes of Argus would be such,<br>
Were they endued with life. &nbsp;Reader, more rhymes<br>
Will not waste in shadowing forth their form:<br>
For other need no straitens, that in this<br>
I may not give my bounty room. &nbsp;But read<br>
Ezekiel; for he paints them, from the north<br>
How he beheld them come by Chebar's flood,<br>
In whirlwind, cloud and fire; and even such<br>
As thou shalt find them character'd by him,<br>
Here were they; save as to the pennons; there,<br>
From him departing, John accords with me.<br>
<br>The space, surrounded by the four, enclos'd<br>
A car triumphal: on two wheels it came<br>
Drawn at a Gryphon's neck; and he above<br>
Stretch'd either wing uplifted, 'tween the midst<br>
And the three listed hues, on each side three;<br>
So that the wings did cleave or injure none;<br>
And out of sight they rose. &nbsp;The members, far<br>
As he was bird, were golden; white the rest<br>
With vermeil intervein'd. &nbsp;So beautiful<br>
A car in Rome ne'er grac'd Augustus pomp,<br>
Or Africanus': e'en the sun's itself<br>
Were poor to this, that chariot of the sun<br>
Erroneous, which in blazing ruin fell<br>
At Tellus' pray'r devout, by the just doom<br>
Mysterious of all-seeing Jove. &nbsp;Three nymphs<br>
at the right wheel, came circling in smooth dance;<br>
The one so ruddy, that her form had scarce<br>
Been known within a furnace of clear flame:<br>
The next did look, as if the flesh and bones<br>
Were emerald: snow new-fallen seem'd the third.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/29-118.jpg"><img alt="29-118th.jpg (39K)" src="images/29-118th.jpg" height="475" width="417"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Now seem'd the white to lead, the ruddy now;<br>
And from her song who led, the others took<br>
Their treasure, swift or slow. &nbsp;At th' other wheel,<br>
A band quaternion, each in purple clad,<br>
Advanc'd with festal step, as of them one<br>
The rest conducted, one, upon whose front<br>
Three eyes were seen. &nbsp;In rear of all this group,<br>
Two old men I beheld, dissimilar<br>
In raiment, but in port and gesture like,<br>
Solid and mainly grave; of whom the one<br>
Did show himself some favour'd counsellor<br>
Of the great Coan, him, whom nature made<br>
To serve the costliest creature of her tribe.<br>
His fellow mark'd an opposite intent,<br>
Bearing a sword, whose glitterance and keen edge,<br>
E'en as I view'd it with the flood between,<br>
Appall'd me. &nbsp;Next four others I beheld,<br>
Of humble seeming: and, behind them all,<br>
One single old man, sleeping, as he came,<br>
With a shrewd visage. &nbsp;And these seven, each<br>
Like the first troop were habited, but wore<br>
No braid of lilies on their temples wreath'd.<br>
Rather with roses and each vermeil flower,<br>
A sight, but little distant, might have sworn,<br>
That they were all on fire above their brow.<br>
<br>Whenas the car was o'er against me, straight.<br>
Was heard a thund'ring, at whose voice it seem'd<br>
The chosen multitude were stay'd; for there,<br>
With the first ensigns, made they solemn halt.</p>

<br><br>

<h2>CANTO XXX</h2>
<br>

<p>Soon as the polar light, which never knows<br>
Setting nor rising, nor the shadowy veil<br>
Of other cloud than sin, fair ornament<br>
Of the first heav'n, to duty each one there<br>
Safely convoying, as that lower doth<br>
The steersman to his port, stood firmly fix'd;<br>
Forthwith the saintly tribe, who in the van<br>
Between the Gryphon and its radiance came,<br>
Did turn them to the car, as to their rest:<br>
And one, as if commission'd from above,<br>
In holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud:<br>
"Come, spouse, from Libanus!" and all the rest<br>
Took up the song&mdash;At the last audit so<br>
The blest shall rise, from forth his cavern each<br>
Uplifting lightly his new-vested flesh,<br>
As, on the sacred litter, at the voice<br>
Authoritative of that elder, sprang<br>
A hundred ministers and messengers<br>
Of life eternal. &nbsp;"Blessed thou! who com'st!"<br>
And, "O," they cried, "from full hands scatter ye<br>
Unwith'ring lilies;" and, so saying, cast<br>
Flowers over head and round them on all sides.<br>
<br>I have beheld, ere now, at break of day,<br>
The eastern clime all roseate, and the sky<br>
Oppos'd, one deep and beautiful serene,<br>
And the sun's face so shaded, and with mists<br>
Attemper'd at lids rising, that the eye<br>
Long while endur'd the sight: thus in a cloud<br>
Of flowers, that from those hands angelic rose,<br>
And down, within and outside of the car,<br>
Fell showering, in white veil with olive wreath'd,<br>
A virgin in my view appear'd, beneath<br>
Green mantle, rob'd in hue of living flame:<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/30-32.jpg"><img alt="30-32th.jpg (34K)" src="images/30-32th.jpg" height="457" width="426"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


And o'er my Spirit, that in former days<br>
Within her presence had abode so long,<br>
No shudd'ring terror crept. &nbsp;Mine eyes no more<br>
Had knowledge of her; yet there mov'd from her<br>
A hidden virtue, at whose touch awak'd,<br>
The power of ancient love was strong within me.<br>
<br>No sooner on my vision streaming, smote<br>
The heav'nly influence, which years past, and e'en<br>
In childhood, thrill'd me, than towards Virgil I<br>
Turn'd me to leftward, panting, like a babe,<br>
That flees for refuge to his mother's breast,<br>
If aught have terrified or work'd him woe:<br>
And would have cried: "There is no dram of blood,<br>
That doth not quiver in me. &nbsp;The old flame<br>
Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire:"<br>
But Virgil had bereav'd us of himself,<br>
Virgil, my best-lov'd father; Virgil, he<br>
To whom I gave me up for safety: nor,<br>
All, our prime mother lost, avail'd to save<br>
My undew'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears.<br>
<br>"Dante, weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay,<br>
Weep thou not yet: behooves thee feel the edge<br>
Of other sword, and thou shalt weep for that."<br>
<br>As to the prow or stern, some admiral<br>
Paces the deck, inspiriting his crew,<br>
When 'mid the sail-yards all hands ply aloof;<br>
Thus on the left side of the car I saw,<br>
(Turning me at the sound of mine own name,<br>
Which here I am compell'd to register)<br>
The virgin station'd, who before appeared<br>
Veil'd in that festive shower angelical.<br>
<br>Towards me, across the stream, she bent her eyes;<br>
Though from her brow the veil descending, bound<br>
With foliage of Minerva, suffer'd not<br>
That I beheld her clearly; then with act<br>
Full royal, still insulting o'er her thrall,<br>
Added, as one, who speaking keepeth back<br>
The bitterest saying, to conclude the speech:<br>
"Observe me well. &nbsp;I am, in sooth, I am<br>
Beatrice. &nbsp;What! and hast thou deign'd at last<br>
Approach the mountain? &nbsp;knewest not, O man!<br>
Thy happiness is whole?" &nbsp;Down fell mine eyes<br>
On the clear fount, but there, myself espying,<br>
Recoil'd, and sought the greensward: such a weight<br>
Of shame was on my forehead. &nbsp;With a mien<br>
Of that stern majesty, which doth surround<br>
mother's presence to her awe-struck child,<br>
She look'd; a flavour of such bitterness<br>
Was mingled in her pity. &nbsp;There her words<br>
Brake off, and suddenly the angels sang:<br>
"In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope hath been:"<br>
But went no farther than, "Thou Lord, hast set<br>
My feet in ample room." &nbsp;As snow, that lies<br>
Amidst the living rafters on the back<br>
Of Italy congeal'd when drifted high<br>
And closely pil'd by rough Sclavonian blasts,<br>
Breathe but the land whereon no shadow falls,<br>
And straightway melting it distils away,<br>
Like a fire-wasted taper: thus was I,<br>
Without a sigh or tear, or ever these<br>
Did sing, that with the chiming of heav'n's sphere,<br>
Still in their warbling chime: but when the strain<br>
Of dulcet symphony, express'd for me<br>
Their soft compassion, more than could the words<br>
"Virgin, why so consum'st him?" &nbsp;then the ice,<br>
Congeal'd about my bosom, turn'd itself<br>
To spirit and water, and with anguish forth<br>
Gush'd through the lips and eyelids from the heart.<br>
<br>Upon the chariot's right edge still she stood,<br>
Immovable, and thus address'd her words<br>
To those bright semblances with pity touch'd:<br>
"Ye in th' eternal day your vigils keep,<br>
So that nor night nor slumber, with close stealth,<br>
Conveys from you a single step in all<br>
The goings on of life: thence with more heed<br>
I shape mine answer, for his ear intended,<br>
Who there stands weeping, that the sorrow now<br>
May equal the transgression. &nbsp;Not alone<br>
Through operation of the mighty orbs,<br>
That mark each seed to some predestin'd aim,<br>
As with aspect or fortunate or ill<br>
The constellations meet, but through benign<br>
Largess of heav'nly graces, which rain down<br>
From such a height, as mocks our vision, this man<br>
Was in the freshness of his being, such,<br>
So gifted virtually, that in him<br>
All better habits wond'rously had thriv'd.<br>
The more of kindly strength is in the soil,<br>
So much doth evil seed and lack of culture<br>
Mar it the more, and make it run to wildness.<br>
These looks sometime upheld him; for I show'd<br>
My youthful eyes, and led him by their light<br>
In upright walking. &nbsp;Soon as I had reach'd<br>
The threshold of my second age, and chang'd<br>
My mortal for immortal, then he left me,<br>
And gave himself to others. &nbsp;When from flesh<br>
To spirit I had risen, and increase<br>
Of beauty and of virtue circled me,<br>
I was less dear to him, and valued less.<br>
His steps were turn'd into deceitful ways,<br>
Following false images of good, that make<br>
No promise perfect. &nbsp;Nor avail'd me aught<br>
To sue for inspirations, with the which,<br>
I, both in dreams of night, and otherwise,<br>
Did call him back; of them so little reck'd him,<br>
Such depth he fell, that all device was short<br>
Of his preserving, save that he should view<br>
The children of perdition. &nbsp;To this end<br>
I visited the purlieus of the dead:<br>
And one, who hath conducted him thus high,<br>
Receiv'd my supplications urg'd with weeping.<br>
It were a breaking of God's high decree,<br>
If Lethe should be past, and such food tasted<br>
Without the cost of some repentant tear."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="31"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXXI</h2>
<br>

<p>"O Thou!" &nbsp;her words she thus without delay<br>
Resuming, turn'd their point on me, to whom<br>
They but with lateral edge seem'd harsh before,<br>
"Say thou, who stand'st beyond the holy stream,<br>
If this be true. &nbsp;A charge so grievous needs<br>
Thine own avowal." &nbsp;On my faculty<br>
Such strange amazement hung, the voice expir'd<br>
Imperfect, ere its organs gave it birth.<br>
<br>A little space refraining, then she spake:<br>
"What dost thou muse on? &nbsp;Answer me. &nbsp;The wave<br>
On thy remembrances of evil yet<br>
Hath done no injury." &nbsp;A mingled sense<br>
Of fear and of confusion, from my lips<br>
Did such a "Yea" produce, as needed help<br>
Of vision to interpret. &nbsp;As when breaks<br>
In act to be discharg'd, a cross-bow bent<br>
Beyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o'erstretch'd,<br>
The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark;<br>
Thus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did I burst<br>
Beneath the heavy load, and thus my voice<br>
Was slacken'd on its way. &nbsp;She straight began:<br>
"When my desire invited thee to love<br>
The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings,<br>
What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain<br>
Did meet thee, that thou so should'st quit the hope<br>
Of further progress, or what bait of ease<br>
Or promise of allurement led thee on<br>
Elsewhere, that thou elsewhere should'st rather wait?"<br>
<br>A bitter sigh I drew, then scarce found voice<br>
To answer, hardly to these sounds my lips<br>
Gave utterance, wailing: "Thy fair looks withdrawn,<br>
Things present, with deceitful pleasures, turn'd<br>
My steps aside." &nbsp;She answering spake: "Hadst thou<br>
Been silent, or denied what thou avow'st,<br>
Thou hadst not hid thy sin the more: such eye<br>
Observes it. &nbsp;But whene'er the sinner's cheek<br>
Breaks forth into the precious-streaming tears<br>
Of self-accusing, in our court the wheel<br>
Of justice doth run counter to the edge.<br>
Howe'er that thou may'st profit by thy shame<br>
For errors past, and that henceforth more strength<br>
May arm thee, when thou hear'st the Siren-voice,<br>
Lay thou aside the motive to this grief,<br>
And lend attentive ear, while I unfold<br>
How opposite a way my buried flesh<br>
Should have impell'd thee. &nbsp;Never didst thou spy<br>
In art or nature aught so passing sweet,<br>
As were the limbs, that in their beauteous frame<br>
Enclos'd me, and are scatter'd now in dust.<br>
If sweetest thing thus fail'd thee with my death,<br>
What, afterward, of mortal should thy wish<br>
Have tempted? &nbsp;When thou first hadst felt the dart<br>
Of perishable things, in my departing<br>
For better realms, thy wing thou should'st have prun'd<br>
To follow me, and never stoop'd again<br>
To 'bide a second blow for a slight girl,<br>
Or other gaud as transient and as vain.<br>
The new and inexperienc'd bird awaits,<br>
Twice it may be, or thrice, the fowler's aim;<br>
But in the sight of one, whose plumes are full,<br>
In vain the net is spread, the arrow wing'd."<br>
<br>I stood, as children silent and asham'd<br>
Stand, list'ning, with their eyes upon the earth,<br>
Acknowledging their fault and self-condemn'd.<br>
And she resum'd: "If, but to hear thus pains thee,<br>
Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!"<br>
<br>With less reluctance yields a sturdy holm,<br>
Rent from its fibers by a blast, that blows<br>
From off the pole, or from Iarbas' land,<br>
Than I at her behest my visage rais'd:<br>
And thus the face denoting by the beard,<br>
I mark'd the secret sting her words convey'd.<br>
<br>No sooner lifted I mine aspect up,<br>
Than downward sunk that vision I beheld<br>
Of goodly creatures vanish; and mine eyes<br>
Yet unassur'd and wavering, bent their light<br>
On Beatrice. &nbsp;Towards the animal,<br>
Who joins two natures in one form, she turn'd,<br>
And, even under shadow of her veil,<br>
And parted by the verdant rill, that flow'd<br>
Between, in loveliness appear'd as much<br>
Her former self surpassing, as on earth<br>
All others she surpass'd. &nbsp;Remorseful goads<br>
Shot sudden through me. &nbsp;Each thing else, the more<br>
Its love had late beguil'd me, now the more<br>
I Was loathsome. &nbsp;On my heart so keenly smote<br>
The bitter consciousness, that on the ground<br>
O'erpower'd I fell: and what my state was then,<br>
She knows who was the cause. &nbsp;When now my strength<br>
Flow'd back, returning outward from the heart,<br>
The lady, whom alone I first had seen,<br>
I found above me. &nbsp;"Loose me not," she cried:<br>
"Loose not thy hold;" and lo! had dragg'd me high<br>
As to my neck into the stream, while she,<br>
Still as she drew me after, swept along,<br>
Swift as a shuttle, bounding o'er the wave.<br>


<br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>


<br>The blessed shore approaching then was heard<br>
So sweetly, "Tu asperges me," that I<br>
May not remember, much less tell the sound.<br>
The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp'd<br>
My temples, and immerg'd me, where 't was fit<br>
The wave should drench me: and thence raising up,<br>
Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs<br>
Presented me so lav'd, and with their arm<br>
They each did cover me. &nbsp;"Here are we nymphs,<br>
And in the heav'n are stars. &nbsp;Or ever earth<br>
Was visited of Beatrice, we<br>
Appointed for her handmaids, tended on her.<br>
We to her eyes will lead thee; but the light<br>
Of gladness that is in them, well to scan,<br>
Those yonder three, of deeper ken than ours,<br>
Thy sight shall quicken." &nbsp;Thus began their song;<br>
And then they led me to the Gryphon's breast,<br>
While, turn'd toward us, Beatrice stood.<br>
"Spare not thy vision. &nbsp;We have stationed thee<br>
Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile<br>
Hath drawn his weapons on thee." &nbsp;As they spake,<br>
A thousand fervent wishes riveted<br>
Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood<br>
Still fix'd toward the Gryphon motionless.<br>
As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus<br>
Within those orbs the twofold being, shone,<br>
For ever varying, in one figure now<br>
Reflected, now in other. &nbsp;Reader! muse<br>
How wond'rous in my sight it seem'd to mark<br>
A thing, albeit steadfast in itself,<br>
Yet in its imag'd semblance mutable.<br>
<br>Full of amaze, and joyous, while my soul<br>
Fed on the viand, whereof still desire<br>
Grows with satiety, the other three<br>
With gesture, that declar'd a loftier line,<br>
Advanc'd: to their own carol on they came<br>
Dancing in festive ring angelical.<br>
<br>"Turn, Beatrice!" was their song: "O turn<br>
Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one,<br>
Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace<br>
Hath measur'd. &nbsp;Gracious at our pray'r vouchsafe<br>
Unveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark<br>
Thy second beauty, now conceal'd." &nbsp;O splendour!<br>
O sacred light eternal! who is he<br>
So pale with musing in Pierian shades,<br>
Or with that fount so lavishly imbued,<br>
Whose spirit should not fail him in th' essay<br>
To represent thee such as thou didst seem,<br>
When under cope of the still-chiming heaven<br>
Thou gav'st to open air thy charms reveal'd.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXXII</h2>
<br>

<p>Mine eyes with such an eager coveting,<br>
Were bent to rid them of their ten years' thirst,<br>
No other sense was waking: and e'en they<br>
Were fenc'd on either side from heed of aught;<br>
So tangled in its custom'd toils that smile<br>
Of saintly brightness drew me to itself,<br>
When forcibly toward the left my sight<br>
The sacred virgins turn'd; for from their lips<br>
I heard the warning sounds: "Too fix'd a gaze!"<br>
<br>Awhile my vision labor'd; as when late<br>
Upon the' o'erstrained eyes the sun hath smote:<br>
But soon to lesser object, as the view<br>
Was now recover'd (lesser in respect<br>
To that excess of sensible, whence late<br>
I had perforce been sunder'd) on their right<br>
I mark'd that glorious army wheel, and turn,<br>
Against the sun and sev'nfold lights, their front.<br>
As when, their bucklers for protection rais'd,<br>
A well-rang'd troop, with portly banners curl'd,<br>
Wheel circling, ere the whole can change their ground:<br>
E'en thus the goodly regiment of heav'n<br>
Proceeding, all did pass us, ere the car<br>
Had slop'd his beam. &nbsp;Attendant at the wheels<br>
The damsels turn'd; and on the Gryphon mov'd<br>
The sacred burden, with a pace so smooth,<br>
No feather on him trembled. &nbsp;The fair dame<br>
Who through the wave had drawn me, companied<br>
By Statius and myself, pursued the wheel,<br>
Whose orbit, rolling, mark'd a lesser arch.<br>
<br>Through the high wood, now void (the more her blame,<br>
Who by the serpent was beguil'd) I past<br>
With step in cadence to the harmony<br>
Angelic. &nbsp;Onward had we mov'd, as far<br>
Perchance as arrow at three several flights<br>
Full wing'd had sped, when from her station down<br>
Descended Beatrice. &nbsp;With one voice<br>
All murmur'd &nbsp;"Adam," circling next a plant<br>
Despoil'd of flowers and leaf on every bough.<br>
Its tresses, spreading more as more they rose,<br>
Were such, as 'midst their forest wilds for height<br>
The Indians might have gaz'd at. &nbsp;"Blessed thou!<br>
Gryphon, whose beak hath never pluck'd that tree<br>
Pleasant to taste: for hence the appetite<br>
Was warp'd to evil." &nbsp;Round the stately trunk<br>
Thus shouted forth the rest, to whom return'd<br>
The animal twice-gender'd: "Yea: for so<br>
The generation of the just are sav'd."<br>
And turning to the chariot-pole, to foot<br>
He drew it of the widow'd branch, and bound<br>
There left unto the stock whereon it grew.<br>
<br>As when large floods of radiance from above<br>
Stream, with that radiance mingled, which ascends<br>
Next after setting of the scaly sign,<br>
Our plants then burgeon, and each wears anew<br>
His wonted colours, ere the sun have yok'd<br>
Beneath another star his flamy steeds;<br>
Thus putting forth a hue, more faint than rose,<br>
And deeper than the violet, was renew'd<br>
The plant, erewhile in all its branches bare.<br>
<br>Unearthly was the hymn, which then arose.<br>
I understood it not, nor to the end<br>
Endur'd the harmony. &nbsp;Had I the skill<br>
To pencil forth, how clos'd th' unpitying eyes<br>
Slumb'ring, when Syrinx warbled, (eyes that paid<br>
So dearly for their watching,) then like painter,<br>
That with a model paints, I might design<br>
The manner of my falling into sleep.<br>
But feign who will the slumber cunningly;<br>
I pass it by to when I wak'd, and tell<br>
How suddenly a flash of splendour rent<br>
The curtain of my sleep, and one cries out:<br>
"Arise, what dost thou?" &nbsp;As the chosen three,<br>
On Tabor's mount, admitted to behold<br>
The blossoming of that fair tree, whose fruit<br>
Is coveted of angels, and doth make<br>
Perpetual feast in heaven, to themselves<br>
Returning at the word, whence deeper sleeps<br>
Were broken, that they their tribe diminish'd saw,<br>
Both Moses and Elias gone, and chang'd<br>
The stole their master wore: thus to myself<br>
Returning, over me beheld I stand<br>
The piteous one, who cross the stream had brought<br>
My steps. &nbsp;"And where," all doubting, I exclaim'd,<br>
"Is Beatrice?"&mdash;"See her," she replied,<br>
"Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root.<br>
Behold th' associate choir that circles her.<br>
The others, with a melody more sweet<br>
And more profound, journeying to higher realms,<br>
Upon the Gryphon tend." &nbsp;If there her words<br>
Were clos'd, I know not; but mine eyes had now<br>
Ta'en view of her, by whom all other thoughts<br>
Were barr'd admittance. &nbsp;On the very ground<br>
Alone she sat, as she had there been left<br>
A guard upon the wain, which I beheld<br>
Bound to the twyform beast. &nbsp;The seven nymphs<br>
Did make themselves a cloister round about her,<br>
And in their hands upheld those lights secure<br>
From blast septentrion and the gusty south.<br>
<br>"A little while thou shalt be forester here:<br>
And citizen shalt be forever with me,<br>
Of that true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman<br>
To profit the misguided world, keep now<br>
Thine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest,<br>
Take heed thou write, returning to that place."<br>
<br>Thus Beatrice: at whose feet inclin'd<br>
Devout, at her behest, my thought and eyes,<br>
I, as she bade, directed. &nbsp;Never fire,<br>
With so swift motion, forth a stormy cloud<br>
Leap'd downward from the welkin's farthest bound,<br>
As I beheld the bird of Jove descending<br>
Pounce on the tree, and, as he rush'd, the rind,<br>
Disparting crush beneath him, buds much more<br>
And leaflets. &nbsp;On the car with all his might<br>
He struck, whence, staggering like a ship, it reel'd,<br>
At random driv'n, to starboard now, o'ercome,<br>
And now to larboard, by the vaulting waves.<br>
<br>Next springing up into the chariot's womb<br>
A fox I saw, with hunger seeming pin'd<br>
Of all good food. &nbsp;But, for his ugly sins<br>
The saintly maid rebuking him, away<br>
Scamp'ring he turn'd, fast as his hide-bound corpse<br>
Would bear him. &nbsp;Next, from whence before he came,<br>
I saw the eagle dart into the hull<br>
O' th' car, and leave it with his feathers lin'd;<br>
And then a voice, like that which issues forth<br>
From heart with sorrow riv'd, did issue forth<br>
From heav'n, and, "O poor bark of mine!" it cried,<br>
"How badly art thou freighted!" &nbsp;Then, it seem'd,<br>
That the earth open'd between either wheel,<br>
And I beheld a dragon issue thence,<br>
That through the chariot fix'd his forked train;<br>
And like a wasp that draggeth back the sting,<br>
So drawing forth his baleful train, he dragg'd<br>
Part of the bottom forth, and went his way<br>
Exulting. &nbsp;What remain'd, as lively turf<br>
With green herb, so did clothe itself with plumes,<br>
Which haply had with purpose chaste and kind<br>
Been offer'd; and therewith were cloth'd the wheels,<br>
Both one and other, and the beam, so quickly<br>
A sigh were not breath'd sooner. &nbsp;Thus transform'd,<br>
The holy structure, through its several parts,<br>
Did put forth heads, three on the beam, and one<br>
On every side; the first like oxen horn'd,<br>
But with a single horn upon their front<br>
The four. &nbsp;Like monster sight hath never seen.<br>
O'er it methought there sat, secure as rock<br>
On mountain's lofty top, a shameless whore,<br>
Whose ken rov'd loosely round her. &nbsp;At her side,<br>
As 't were that none might bear her off, I saw<br>
A giant stand; and ever, and anon<br>
They mingled kisses. &nbsp;But, her lustful eyes<br>
Chancing on me to wander, that fell minion<br>
Scourg'd her from head to foot all o'er; then full<br>
Of jealousy, and fierce with rage, unloos'd<br>
The monster, and dragg'd on, so far across<br>
The forest, that from me its shades alone<br>
Shielded the harlot and the new-form'd brute.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXXIII</h2>
<br>

<p>"The heathen, Lord! are come!" responsive thus,<br>
The trinal now, and now the virgin band<br>
Quaternion, their sweet psalmody began,<br>
Weeping; and Beatrice listen'd, sad<br>
And sighing, to the song', in such a mood,<br>
That Mary, as she stood beside the cross,<br>
Was scarce more chang'd. &nbsp;But when they gave her place<br>
To speak, then, risen upright on her feet,<br>
She, with a colour glowing bright as fire,<br>
Did answer: "Yet a little while, and ye<br>
Shall see me not; and, my beloved sisters,<br>
Again a little while, and ye shall see me."<br>
<br>Before her then she marshall'd all the seven,<br>
And, beck'ning only motion'd me, the dame,<br>
And that remaining sage, to follow her.<br>
<br>So on she pass'd; and had not set, I ween,<br>
Her tenth step to the ground, when with mine eyes<br>
Her eyes encounter'd; and, with visage mild,<br>
"So mend thy pace," she cried, "that if my words<br>
Address thee, thou mayst still be aptly plac'd<br>
To hear them." &nbsp;Soon as duly to her side<br>
I now had hasten'd: "Brother!" she began,<br>
"Why mak'st thou no attempt at questioning,<br>
As thus we walk together?" &nbsp;Like to those<br>
Who, speaking with too reverent an awe<br>
Before their betters, draw not forth the voice<br>
Alive unto their lips, befell me shell<br>
That I in sounds imperfect thus began:<br>
"Lady! what I have need of, that thou know'st,<br>
And what will suit my need." &nbsp;She answering thus:<br>
"Of fearfulness and shame, I will, that thou<br>
Henceforth do rid thee: that thou speak no more,<br>
As one who dreams. &nbsp;Thus far be taught of me:<br>
The vessel, which thou saw'st the serpent break,<br>
Was and is not: let him, who hath the blame,<br>
Hope not to scare God's vengeance with a sop.<br>
Without an heir for ever shall not be<br>
That eagle, he, who left the chariot plum'd,<br>
Which monster made it first and next a prey.<br>
Plainly I view, and therefore speak, the stars<br>
E'en now approaching, whose conjunction, free<br>
From all impediment and bar, brings on<br>
A season, in the which, one sent from God,<br>
(Five hundred, five, and ten, do mark him out)<br>
That foul one, and th' accomplice of her guilt,<br>
The giant, both shall slay. &nbsp;And if perchance<br>
My saying, dark as Themis or as Sphinx,<br>
Fail to persuade thee, (since like them it foils<br>
The intellect with blindness) yet ere long<br>
Events shall be the Naiads, that will solve<br>
This knotty riddle, and no damage light<br>
On flock or field. &nbsp;Take heed; and as these words<br>
By me are utter'd, teach them even so<br>
To those who live that life, which is a race<br>
To death: and when thou writ'st them, keep in mind<br>
Not to conceal how thou hast seen the plant,<br>
That twice hath now been spoil'd. &nbsp;This whoso robs,<br>
This whoso plucks, with blasphemy of deed<br>
Sins against God, who for his use alone<br>
Creating hallow'd it. &nbsp;For taste of this,<br>
In pain and in desire, five thousand years<br>
And upward, the first soul did yearn for him,<br>
Who punish'd in himself the fatal gust.<br>
<br>"Thy reason slumbers, if it deem this height<br>
And summit thus inverted of the plant,<br>
Without due cause: and were not vainer thoughts,<br>
As Elsa's numbing waters, to thy soul,<br>
And their fond pleasures had not dyed it dark<br>
As Pyramus the mulberry, thou hadst seen,<br>
In such momentous circumstance alone,<br>
God's equal justice morally implied<br>
In the forbidden tree. &nbsp;But since I mark thee<br>
In understanding harden'd into stone,<br>
And, to that hardness, spotted too and stain'd,<br>
So that thine eye is dazzled at my word,<br>
I will, that, if not written, yet at least<br>
Painted thou take it in thee, for the cause,<br>
That one brings home his staff inwreath'd with palm.<br>
<br>I thus: "As wax by seal, that changeth not<br>
Its impress, now is stamp'd my brain by thee.<br>
But wherefore soars thy wish'd-for speech so high<br>
Beyond my sight, that loses it the more,<br>
The more it strains to reach it?"&mdash;"To the end<br>
That thou mayst know," she answer'd straight, "the school,<br>
That thou hast follow'd; and how far behind,<br>
When following my discourse, its learning halts:<br>
And mayst behold your art, from the divine<br>
As distant, as the disagreement is<br>
'Twixt earth and heaven's most high and rapturous orb."<br>
<br>"I not remember," I replied, "that e'er<br>
I was estrang'd from thee, nor for such fault<br>
Doth conscience chide me." &nbsp;Smiling she return'd:<br>
"If thou canst, not remember, call to mind<br>
How lately thou hast drunk of Lethe's wave;<br>
And, sure as smoke doth indicate a flame,<br>
In that forgetfulness itself conclude<br>
Blame from thy alienated will incurr'd.<br>
From henceforth verily my words shall be<br>
As naked as will suit them to appear<br>
In thy unpractis'd view." &nbsp;More sparkling now,<br>
And with retarded course the sun possess'd<br>
The circle of mid-day, that varies still<br>
As th' aspect varies of each several clime,<br>
When, as one, sent in vaward of a troop<br>
For escort, pauses, if perchance he spy<br>
Vestige of somewhat strange and rare: so paus'd<br>
The sev'nfold band, arriving at the verge<br>
Of a dun umbrage hoar, such as is seen,<br>
Beneath green leaves and gloomy branches, oft<br>
To overbrow a bleak and alpine cliff.<br>
And, where they stood, before them, as it seem'd,<br>
Tigris and Euphrates both beheld,<br>
Forth from one fountain issue; and, like friends,<br>
Linger at parting. "O enlight'ning beam!<br>
O glory of our kind! beseech thee say<br>
What water this, which from one source deriv'd<br>
Itself removes to distance from itself?"<br>
<br>To such entreaty answer thus was made:<br>
"Entreat Matilda, that she teach thee this."<br>
<br>And here, as one, who clears himself of blame<br>
Imputed, the fair dame return'd: "Of me<br>
He this and more hath learnt; and I am safe<br>
That Lethe's water hath not hid it from him."<br>
<br>And Beatrice: "Some more pressing care<br>
That oft the memory 'reeves, perchance hath made<br>
His mind's eye dark. &nbsp;But lo! where Eunoe cows!<br>
Lead thither; and, as thou art wont, revive<br>
His fainting virtue." &nbsp;As a courteous spirit,<br>
That proffers no excuses, but as soon<br>
As he hath token of another's will,<br>
Makes it his own; when she had ta'en me, thus<br>
The lovely maiden mov'd her on, and call'd<br>
To Statius with an air most lady-like:<br>
"Come thou with him." &nbsp;Were further space allow'd,<br>
Then, Reader, might I sing, though but in part,<br>
That beverage, with whose sweetness I had ne'er<br>
Been sated. &nbsp;But, since all the leaves are full,<br>
Appointed for this second strain, mine art<br>
With warning bridle checks me. &nbsp;I return'd<br>
From the most holy wave, regenerate,<br>
If 'en as new plants renew'd with foliage new,<br>
Pure and made apt for mounting to the stars.</p>
