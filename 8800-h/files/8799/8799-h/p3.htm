<h2>CANTO XXII</h2>
<br>

<p>Astounded, to the guardian of my steps<br>
I turn'd me, like the chill, who always runs<br>
Thither for succour, where he trusteth most,<br>
And she was like the mother, who her son<br>
Beholding pale and breathless, with her voice<br>
Soothes him, and he is cheer'd; for thus she spake,<br>
Soothing me: "Know'st not thou, thou art in heav'n?<br>
And know'st not thou, whatever is in heav'n,<br>
Is holy, and that nothing there is done<br>
But is done zealously and well? &nbsp;Deem now,<br>
What change in thee the song, and what my smile<br>
had wrought, since thus the shout had pow'r to move thee.<br>
In which couldst thou have understood their prayers,<br>
The vengeance were already known to thee,<br>
Which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour,<br>
The sword of heav'n is not in haste to smite,<br>
Nor yet doth linger, save unto his seeming,<br>
Who in desire or fear doth look for it.<br>
But elsewhere now l bid thee turn thy view;<br>
So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold."<br>
Mine eyes directing, as she will'd, I saw<br>
A hundred little spheres, that fairer grew<br>
By interchange of splendour. &nbsp;I remain'd,<br>
As one, who fearful of o'er-much presuming,<br>
Abates in him the keenness of desire,<br>
Nor dares to question, when amid those pearls,<br>
One largest and most lustrous onward drew,<br>
That it might yield contentment to my wish;<br>
And from within it these the sounds I heard.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If thou, like me, beheldst the charity<br>
That burns amongst us, what thy mind conceives,<br>
Were utter'd. &nbsp;But that, ere the lofty bound<br>
Thou reach, expectance may not weary thee,<br>
I will make answer even to the thought,<br>
Which thou hast such respect of. &nbsp;In old days,<br>
That mountain, at whose side Cassino rests,<br>
Was on its height frequented by a race<br>
Deceived and ill dispos'd: and I it was,<br>
Who thither carried first the name of Him,<br>
Who brought the soul-subliming truth to man.<br>
And such a speeding grace shone over me,<br>
That from their impious worship I reclaim'd<br>
The dwellers round about, who with the world<br>
Were in delusion lost. &nbsp;These other flames,<br>
The spirits of men contemplative, were all<br>
Enliven'd by that warmth, whose kindly force<br>
Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness.<br>
Here is Macarius; Romoaldo here:<br>
And here my brethren, who their steps refrain'd<br>
Within the cloisters, and held firm their heart."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answ'ring, thus; "Thy gentle words and kind,<br>
And this the cheerful semblance, I behold<br>
Not unobservant, beaming in ye all,<br>
Have rais'd assurance in me, wakening it<br>
Full-blossom'd in my bosom, as a rose<br>
Before the sun, when the consummate flower<br>
Has spread to utmost amplitude. &nbsp;Of thee<br>
Therefore entreat I, father! to declare<br>
If I may gain such favour, as to gaze<br>
Upon thine image, by no covering veil'd."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother!" &nbsp;he thus rejoin'd, "in the last sphere<br>
Expect completion of thy lofty aim,<br>
For there on each desire completion waits,<br>
And there on mine: where every aim is found<br>
Perfect, entire, and for fulfillment ripe.<br>
There all things are as they have ever been:<br>
For space is none to bound, nor pole divides,<br>
Our ladder reaches even to that clime,<br>
And so at giddy distance mocks thy view.<br>
Thither the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretch<br>
Its topmost round, when it appear'd to him<br>
With angels laden. &nbsp;But to mount it now<br>
None lifts his foot from earth: and hence my rule<br>
Is left a profitless stain upon the leaves;<br>
The walls, for abbey rear'd, turned into dens,<br>
The cowls to sacks choak'd up with musty meal.<br>
Foul usury doth not more lift itself<br>
Against God's pleasure, than that fruit which makes<br>
The hearts of monks so wanton: for whate'er<br>
Is in the church's keeping, all pertains.<br>
To such, as sue for heav'n's sweet sake, and not<br>
To those who in respect of kindred claim,<br>
Or on more vile allowance. &nbsp;Mortal flesh<br>
Is grown so dainty, good beginnings last not<br>
From the oak's birth, unto the acorn's setting.<br>
His convent Peter founded without gold<br>
Or silver; I with pray'rs and fasting mine;<br>
And Francis his in meek humility.<br>
And if thou note the point, whence each proceeds,<br>
Then look what it hath err'd to, thou shalt find<br>
The white grown murky. &nbsp;Jordan was turn'd back;<br>
And a less wonder, then the refluent sea,<br>
May at God's pleasure work amendment here."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saying, to his assembly back he drew:<br>
And they together cluster'd into one,<br>
Then all roll'd upward like an eddying wind.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet dame beckon'd me to follow them:<br>
And, by that influence only, so prevail'd<br>
Over my nature, that no natural motion,<br>
Ascending or descending here below,<br>
Had, as I mounted, with my pennon vied.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, reader, as my hope is to return<br>
Unto the holy triumph, for the which<br>
I ofttimes wail my sins, and smite my breast,<br>
Thou hadst been longer drawing out and thrusting<br>
Thy finger in the fire, than I was, ere<br>
The sign, that followeth Taurus, I beheld,<br>
And enter'd its precinct. &nbsp;O glorious stars!<br>
O light impregnate with exceeding virtue!<br>
To whom whate'er of genius lifteth me<br>
Above the vulgar, grateful I refer;<br>
With ye the parent of all mortal life<br>
Arose and set, when I did first inhale<br>
The Tuscan air; and afterward, when grace<br>
Vouchsaf'd me entrance to the lofty wheel<br>
That in its orb impels ye, fate decreed<br>
My passage at your clime. &nbsp;To you my soul<br>
Devoutly sighs, for virtue even now<br>
To meet the hard emprize that draws me on.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou art so near the sum of blessedness,"<br>
Said Beatrice, "that behooves thy ken<br>
Be vigilant and clear. &nbsp;And, to this end,<br>
Or even thou advance thee further, hence<br>
Look downward, and contemplate, what a world<br>
Already stretched under our feet there lies:<br>
So as thy heart may, in its blithest mood,<br>
Present itself to the triumphal throng,<br>
Which through the' etherial concave comes rejoicing."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I straight obey'd; and with mine eye return'd<br>
Through all the seven spheres, and saw this globe<br>
So pitiful of semblance, that perforce<br>
It moved my smiles: and him in truth I hold<br>
For wisest, who esteems it least: whose thoughts<br>
Elsewhere are fix'd, him worthiest call and best.<br>
I saw the daughter of Latona shine<br>
Without the shadow, whereof late I deem'd<br>
That dense and rare were cause. &nbsp;Here I sustain'd<br>
The visage, Hyperion! of thy sun;<br>
And mark'd, how near him with their circle, round<br>
Move Maia and Dione; here discern'd<br>
Jove's tempering 'twixt his sire and son; and hence<br>
Their changes and their various aspects<br>
Distinctly scann'd. &nbsp;Nor might I not descry<br>
Of all the seven, how bulky each, how swift;<br>
Nor of their several distances not learn.<br>
This petty area (o'er the which we stride<br>
So fiercely), as along the eternal twins<br>
I wound my way, appear'd before me all,<br>
Forth from the havens stretch'd unto the hills.<br>
Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes return'd.</p>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXIII</h2>
<br>

<p>E'en as the bird, who midst the leafy bower<br>
Has, in her nest, sat darkling through the night,<br>
With her sweet brood, impatient to descry<br>
Their wished looks, and to bring home their food,<br>
In the fond quest unconscious of her toil:<br>
She, of the time prevenient, on the spray,<br>
That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze<br>
Expects the sun; nor ever, till the dawn,<br>
Removeth from the east her eager ken;<br>
So stood the dame erect, and bent her glance<br>
Wistfully on that region, where the sun<br>
Abateth most his speed; that, seeing her<br>
Suspense and wand'ring, I became as one,<br>
In whom desire is waken'd, and the hope<br>
Of somewhat new to come fills with delight.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short space ensued; I was not held, I say,<br>
Long in expectance, when I saw the heav'n<br>
Wax more and more resplendent; and, "Behold,"<br>
Cried Beatrice, "the triumphal hosts<br>
Of Christ, and all the harvest reap'd at length<br>
Of thy ascending up these spheres." &nbsp;Meseem'd,<br>
That, while she spake her image all did burn,<br>
And in her eyes such fullness was of joy,<br>
And I am fain to pass unconstrued by.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the calm full moon, when Trivia smiles,<br>
In peerless beauty, 'mid th' eternal nympus,<br>
That paint through all its gulfs the blue profound<br>
In bright pre-eminence so saw I there,<br>
O'er million lamps a sun, from whom all drew<br>
Their radiance as from ours the starry train:<br>
And through the living light so lustrous glow'd<br>
The substance, that my ken endur'd it not.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Beatrice! sweet and precious guide!<br>
Who cheer'd me with her comfortable words!<br>
"Against the virtue, that o'erpow'reth thee,<br>
Avails not to resist. &nbsp;Here is the might,<br>
And here the wisdom, which did open lay<br>
The path, that had been yearned for so long,<br>
Betwixt the heav'n and earth." &nbsp;Like to the fire,<br>
That, in a cloud imprison'd doth break out<br>
Expansive, so that from its womb enlarg'd,<br>
It falleth against nature to the ground;<br>
Thus in that heav'nly banqueting my soul<br>
Outgrew herself; and, in the transport lost.<br>
Holds now remembrance none of what she was.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ope thou thine eyes, and mark me: thou hast seen<br>
Things, that empower thee to sustain my smile."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was as one, when a forgotten dream<br>
Doth come across him, and he strives in vain<br>
To shape it in his fantasy again,<br>
Whenas that gracious boon was proffer'd me,<br>
Which never may be cancel'd from the book,<br>
Wherein the past is written. &nbsp;Now were all<br>
Those tongues to sound, that have on sweetest milk<br>
Of Polyhymnia and her sisters fed<br>
And fatten'd, not with all their help to boot,<br>
Unto the thousandth parcel of the truth,<br>
My song might shadow forth that saintly smile,<br>
flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought.<br>
And with such figuring of Paradise<br>
The sacred strain must leap, like one, that meets<br>
A sudden interruption to his road.<br>
But he, who thinks how ponderous the theme,<br>
And that 't is lain upon a mortal shoulder,<br>
May pardon, if it tremble with the burden.<br>
The track, our ventrous keel must furrow, brooks<br>
No unribb'd pinnace, no self-sparing pilot.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why doth my face," said Beatrice, "thus<br>
Enamour thee, as that thou dost not turn<br>
Unto the beautiful garden, blossoming<br>
Beneath the rays of Christ? &nbsp;Here is the rose,<br>
Wherein the word divine was made incarnate;<br>
And here the lilies, by whose odour known<br>
The way of life was follow'd." &nbsp;Prompt I heard<br>
Her bidding, and encounter once again<br>
The strife of aching vision. &nbsp;As erewhile,<br>
Through glance of sunlight, stream'd through broken cloud,<br>
Mine eyes a flower-besprinkled mead have seen,<br>
Though veil'd themselves in shade; so saw I there<br>
Legions of splendours, on whom burning rays<br>
Shed lightnings from above, yet saw I not<br>
The fountain whence they flow'd. &nbsp;O gracious virtue!<br>
Thou, whose broad stamp is on them, higher up<br>
Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room<br>
To my o'erlabour'd sight: when at the name<br>
Of that fair flower, whom duly I invoke<br>
Both morn and eve, my soul, with all her might<br>
Collected, on the goodliest ardour fix'd.<br>
And, as the bright dimensions of the star<br>
In heav'n excelling, as once here on earth<br>
Were, in my eyeballs lively portray'd,<br>
Lo! from within the sky a cresset fell,<br>
Circling in fashion of a diadem,<br>
And girt the star, and hov'ring round it wheel'd.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever melody sounds sweetest here,<br>
And draws the spirit most unto itself,<br>
Might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder,<br>
Compar'd unto the sounding of that lyre,<br>
Wherewith the goodliest sapphire, that inlays<br>
The floor of heav'n, was crown'd. "Angelic Love,<br>
I am, who thus with hov'ring flight enwheel<br>
The lofty rapture from that womb inspir'd,<br>
Where our desire did dwell: and round thee so,<br>
Lady of Heav'n! will hover; long as thou<br>
Thy Son shalt follow, and diviner joy<br>
Shall from thy presence gild the highest sphere."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such close was to the circling melody:<br>
And, as it ended, all the other lights<br>
Took up the strain, and echoed Mary's name.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robe, that with its regal folds enwraps<br>
The world, and with the nearer breath of God<br>
Doth burn and quiver, held so far retir'd<br>
Its inner hem and skirting over us,<br>
That yet no glimmer of its majesty<br>
Had stream'd unto me: therefore were mine eyes<br>
Unequal to pursue the crowned flame,<br>
That rose and sought its natal seed of fire;<br>
And like to babe, that stretches forth its arms<br>
For very eagerness towards the breast,<br>
After the milk is taken; so outstretch'd<br>
Their wavy summits all the fervent band,<br>
Through zealous love to Mary: then in view<br>
There halted, and "Regina Coeli" sang<br>
So sweetly, the delight hath left me never.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O what o'erflowing plenty is up-pil'd<br>
In those rich-laden coffers, which below<br>
Sow'd the good seed, whose harvest now they keep.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the treasures tasted, that with tears<br>
Were in the Babylonian exile won,<br>
When gold had fail'd them. &nbsp;Here in synod high<br>
Of ancient council with the new conven'd,<br>
Under the Son of Mary and of God,<br>
Victorious he his mighty triumph holds,<br>
To whom the keys of glory were assign'd.</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXIV</h2>
<br>

<p>"O ye! in chosen fellowship advanc'd<br>
To the great supper of the blessed Lamb,<br>
Whereon who feeds hath every wish fulfill'd!<br>
If to this man through God's grace be vouchsaf'd<br>
Foretaste of that, which from your table falls,<br>
Or ever death his fated term prescribe;<br>
Be ye not heedless of his urgent will;<br>
But may some influence of your sacred dews<br>
Sprinkle him. &nbsp;Of the fount ye alway drink,<br>
Whence flows what most he craves." &nbsp;Beatrice spake,<br>
And the rejoicing spirits, like to spheres<br>
On firm-set poles revolving, trail'd a blaze<br>
Of comet splendour; and as wheels, that wind<br>
Their circles in the horologe, so work<br>
The stated rounds, that to th' observant eye<br>
The first seems still, and, as it flew, the last;<br>
E'en thus their carols weaving variously,<br>
They by the measure pac'd, or swift, or slow,<br>
Made me to rate the riches of their joy.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that, which I did note in beauty most<br>
Excelling, saw I issue forth a flame<br>
So bright, as none was left more goodly there.<br>
Round Beatrice thrice it wheel'd about,<br>
With so divine a song, that fancy's ear<br>
Records it not; and the pen passeth on<br>
And leaves a blank: for that our mortal speech,<br>
Nor e'en the inward shaping of the brain,<br>
Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O saintly sister mine! thy prayer devout<br>
Is with so vehement affection urg'd,<br>
Thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were the accents towards my lady breath'd<br>
From that blest ardour, soon as it was stay'd:<br>
To whom she thus: "O everlasting light<br>
Of him, within whose mighty grasp our Lord<br>
Did leave the keys, which of this wondrous bliss<br>
He bare below! tent this man, as thou wilt,<br>
With lighter probe or deep, touching the faith,<br>
By the which thou didst on the billows walk.<br>
If he in love, in hope, and in belief,<br>
Be steadfast, is not hid from thee: for thou<br>
Hast there thy ken, where all things are beheld<br>
In liveliest portraiture. &nbsp;But since true faith<br>
Has peopled this fair realm with citizens,<br>
Meet is, that to exalt its glory more,<br>
Thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to the bachelor, who arms himself,<br>
And speaks not, till the master have propos'd<br>
The question, to approve, and not to end it;<br>
So I, in silence, arm'd me, while she spake,<br>
Summoning up each argument to aid;<br>
As was behooveful for such questioner,<br>
And such profession: "As good Christian ought,<br>
Declare thee, What is faith?" &nbsp;Whereat I rais'd<br>
My forehead to the light, whence this had breath'd,<br>
Then turn'd to Beatrice, and in her looks<br>
Approval met, that from their inmost fount<br>
I should unlock the waters. &nbsp;"May the grace,<br>
That giveth me the captain of the church<br>
For confessor," said I, "vouchsafe to me<br>
Apt utterance for my thoughts!" then added: "Sire!<br>
E'en as set down by the unerring style<br>
Of thy dear brother, who with thee conspir'd<br>
To bring Rome in unto the way of life,<br>
Faith of things hop'd is substance, and the proof<br>
Of things not seen; and herein doth consist<br>
Methinks its essence,"&mdash;"Rightly hast thou deem'd,"<br>
Was answer'd: "if thou well discern, why first<br>
He hath defin'd it, substance, and then proof."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deep things," I replied, "which here I scan<br>
Distinctly, are below from mortal eye<br>
So hidden, they have in belief alone<br>
Their being, on which credence hope sublime<br>
Is built; and therefore substance it intends.<br>
And inasmuch as we must needs infer<br>
From such belief our reasoning, all respect<br>
To other view excluded, hence of proof<br>
Th' intention is deriv'd." &nbsp;Forthwith I heard:<br>
"If thus, whate'er by learning men attain,<br>
Were understood, the sophist would want room<br>
To exercise his wit." &nbsp;So breath'd the flame<br>
Of love: then added: "Current is the coin<br>
Thou utter'st, both in weight and in alloy.<br>
But tell me, if thou hast it in thy purse."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even so glittering and so round," said I,<br>
"I not a whit misdoubt of its assay."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next issued from the deep imbosom'd splendour:<br>
"Say, whence the costly jewel, on the which<br>
Is founded every virtue, came to thee."<br>
"The flood," I answer'd, "from the Spirit of God<br>
Rain'd down upon the ancient bond and new,&mdash;<br>
Here is the reas'ning, that convinceth me<br>
So feelingly, each argument beside<br>
Seems blunt and forceless in comparison."<br>
Then heard I: "Wherefore holdest thou that each,<br>
The elder proposition and the new,<br>
Which so persuade thee, are the voice of heav'n?"<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The works, that follow'd, evidence their truth;"<br>
I answer'd: "Nature did not make for these<br>
The iron hot, or on her anvil mould them."<br>
"Who voucheth to thee of the works themselves,"<br>
Was the reply, "that they in very deed<br>
Are that they purport? &nbsp;None hath sworn so to thee."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That all the world," said I, "should have been turn'd<br>
To Christian, and no miracle been wrought,<br>
Would in itself be such a miracle,<br>
The rest were not an hundredth part so great.<br>
E'en thou wentst forth in poverty and hunger<br>
To set the goodly plant, that from the vine,<br>
It once was, now is grown unsightly bramble."<br>
That ended, through the high celestial court<br>
Resounded all the spheres. &nbsp;"Praise we one God!"<br>
In song of most unearthly melody.<br>
And when that Worthy thus, from branch to branch,<br>
Examining, had led me, that we now<br>
Approach'd the topmost bough, he straight resum'd;<br>
"The grace, that holds sweet dalliance with thy soul,<br>
So far discreetly hath thy lips unclos'd<br>
That, whatsoe'er has past them, I commend.<br>
Behooves thee to express, what thou believ'st,<br>
The next, and whereon thy belief hath grown."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O saintly sire and spirit!" &nbsp;I began,<br>
"Who seest that, which thou didst so believe,<br>
As to outstrip feet younger than thine own,<br>
Toward the sepulchre? &nbsp;thy will is here,<br>
That I the tenour of my creed unfold;<br>
And thou the cause of it hast likewise ask'd.<br>
And I reply: I in one God believe,<br>
One sole eternal Godhead, of whose love<br>
All heav'n is mov'd, himself unmov'd the while.<br>
Nor demonstration physical alone,<br>
Or more intelligential and abstruse,<br>
Persuades me to this faith; but from that truth<br>
It cometh to me rather, which is shed<br>
Through Moses, the rapt Prophets, and the Psalms.<br>
The Gospel, and that ye yourselves did write,<br>
When ye were gifted of the Holy Ghost.<br>
In three eternal Persons I believe,<br>
Essence threefold and one, mysterious league<br>
Of union absolute, which, many a time,<br>
The word of gospel lore upon my mind<br>
Imprints: and from this germ, this firstling spark,<br>
The lively flame dilates, and like heav'n's star<br>
Doth glitter in me." &nbsp;As the master hears,<br>
Well pleas'd, and then enfoldeth in his arms<br>
The servant, who hath joyful tidings brought,<br>
And having told the errand keeps his peace;<br>
Thus benediction uttering with song<br>
Soon as my peace I held, compass'd me thrice<br>
The apostolic radiance, whose behest<br>
Had op'd lips; so well their answer pleas'd.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXV</h2>
<br>


<p>If e'er the sacred poem that hath made<br>
Both heav'n and earth copartners in its toil,<br>
And with lean abstinence, through many a year,<br>
Faded my brow, be destin'd to prevail<br>
Over the cruelty, which bars me forth<br>
Of the fair sheep-fold, where a sleeping lamb<br>
The wolves set on and fain had worried me,<br>
With other voice and fleece of other grain<br>
I shall forthwith return, and, standing up<br>
At my baptismal font, shall claim the wreath<br>
Due to the poet's temples: for I there<br>
First enter'd on the faith which maketh souls<br>
Acceptable to God: and, for its sake,<br>
Peter had then circled my forehead thus.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next from the squadron, whence had issued forth<br>
The first fruit of Christ's vicars on the earth,<br>
Toward us mov'd a light, at view whereof<br>
My Lady, full of gladness, spake to me:<br>
"Lo! lo! behold the peer of mickle might,<br>
That makes Falicia throng'd with visitants!"<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the ring-dove by his mate alights,<br>
In circles each about the other wheels,<br>
And murmuring cooes his fondness; thus saw I<br>
One, of the other great and glorious prince,<br>
With kindly greeting hail'd, extolling both<br>
Their heavenly banqueting; but when an end<br>
Was to their gratulation, silent, each,<br>
Before me sat they down, so burning bright,<br>
I could not look upon them. &nbsp;Smiling then,<br>
Beatrice spake: "O life in glory shrin'd!"<br>
Who didst the largess of our kingly court<br>
Set down with faithful pen! let now thy voice<br>
Of hope the praises in this height resound.<br>
For thou, who figur'st them in shapes, as clear,<br>
As Jesus stood before thee, well can'st speak them."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lift up thy head, and be thou strong in trust:<br>
For that, which hither from the mortal world<br>
Arriveth, must be ripen'd in our beam."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such cheering accents from the second flame<br>
Assur'd me; and mine eyes I lifted up<br>
Unto the mountains that had bow'd them late<br>
With over-heavy burden. &nbsp;"Sith our Liege<br>
Wills of his grace that thou, or ere thy death,<br>
In the most secret council, with his lords<br>
Shouldst be confronted, so that having view'd<br>
The glories of our court, thou mayst therewith<br>
Thyself, and all who hear, invigorate<br>
With hope, that leads to blissful end; declare,<br>
What is that hope, how it doth flourish in thee,<br>
And whence thou hadst it?" &nbsp;Thus proceeding still,<br>
The second light: and she, whose gentle love<br>
My soaring pennons in that lofty flight<br>
Escorted, thus preventing me, rejoin'd:<br>
Among her sons, not one more full of hope,<br>
Hath the church militant: so 't is of him<br>
Recorded in the sun, whose liberal orb<br>
Enlighteneth all our tribe: and ere his term<br>
Of warfare, hence permitted he is come,<br>
From Egypt to Jerusalem, to see.<br>
The other points, both which thou hast inquir'd,<br>
Not for more knowledge, but that he may tell<br>
How dear thou holdst the virtue, these to him<br>
Leave I; for he may answer thee with ease,<br>
And without boasting, so God give him grace."<br>
Like to the scholar, practis'd in his task,<br>
Who, willing to give proof of diligence,<br>
Seconds his teacher gladly, "Hope," said I,<br>
"Is of the joy to come a sure expectance,<br>
Th' effect of grace divine and merit preceding.<br>
This light from many a star visits my heart,<br>
But flow'd to me the first from him, who sang<br>
The songs of the Supreme, himself supreme<br>
Among his tuneful brethren. &nbsp;'Let all hope<br>
In thee,' so speak his anthem, 'who have known<br>
Thy name;' and with my faith who know not that?<br>
From thee, the next, distilling from his spring,<br>
In thine epistle, fell on me the drops<br>
So plenteously, that I on others shower<br>
The influence of their dew." &nbsp;Whileas I spake,<br>
A lamping, as of quick and vollied lightning,<br>
Within the bosom of that mighty sheen,<br>
Play'd tremulous; then forth these accents breath'd:<br>
"Love for the virtue which attended me<br>
E'en to the palm, and issuing from the field,<br>
Glows vigorous yet within me, and inspires<br>
To ask of thee, whom also it delights;<br>
What promise thou from hope in chief dost win."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both scriptures, new and ancient," I reply'd;<br>
"Propose the mark (which even now I view)<br>
For souls belov'd of God. Isaias saith,<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That, in their own land, each one must be clad<br>
In twofold vesture; and their proper lands this delicious life.'<br>
In terms more full,<br>
And clearer far, thy brother hath set forth<br>
This revelation to us, where he tells<br>
Of the white raiment destin'd to the saints."<br>
And, as the words were ending, from above,<br>
"They hope in thee," first heard we cried: whereto<br>
Answer'd the carols all. &nbsp;Amidst them next,<br>
A light of so clear amplitude emerg'd,<br>
That winter's month were but a single day,<br>
Were such a crystal in the Cancer's sign.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like as a virgin riseth up, and goes,<br>
And enters on the mazes of the dance,<br>
Though gay, yet innocent of worse intent,<br>
Than to do fitting honour to the bride;<br>
So I beheld the new effulgence come<br>
Unto the other two, who in a ring<br>
Wheel'd, as became their rapture. &nbsp;In the dance<br>
And in the song it mingled. &nbsp;And the dame<br>
Held on them fix'd her looks: e'en as the spouse<br>
Silent and moveless. &nbsp;"This is he, who lay<br>
Upon the bosom of our pelican:<br>
This he, into whose keeping from the cross<br>
The mighty charge was given." &nbsp;Thus she spake,<br>
Yet therefore naught the more remov'd her Sight<br>
From marking them, or ere her words began,<br>
Or when they clos'd. &nbsp;As he, who looks intent,<br>
And strives with searching ken, how he may see<br>
The sun in his eclipse, and, through desire<br>
Of seeing, loseth power of sight: so I<br>
Peer'd on that last resplendence, while I heard:<br>
"Why dazzlest thou thine eyes in seeking that,<br>
Which here abides not? &nbsp;Earth my body is,<br>
In earth: and shall be, with the rest, so long,<br>
As till our number equal the decree<br>
Of the Most High. &nbsp;The two that have ascended,<br>
In this our blessed cloister, shine alone<br>
With the two garments. &nbsp;So report below."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when, for ease of labour, or to shun<br>
Suspected peril at a whistle's breath,<br>
The oars, erewhile dash'd frequent in the wave,<br>
All rest; the flamy circle at that voice<br>
So rested, and the mingling sound was still,<br>
Which from the trinal band soft-breathing rose.<br>
I turn'd, but ah! how trembled in my thought,<br>
When, looking at my side again to see<br>
Beatrice, I descried her not, although<br>
Not distant, on the happy coast she stood.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="26"></a>
<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XXVI</h2>
<br>

<p>With dazzled eyes, whilst wond'ring I remain'd,<br>
Forth of the beamy flame which dazzled me,<br>
Issued a breath, that in attention mute<br>
Detain'd me; and these words it spake: "'T were well,<br>
That, long as till thy vision, on my form<br>
O'erspent, regain its virtue, with discourse<br>
Thou compensate the brief delay. &nbsp;Say then,<br>
Beginning, to what point thy soul aspires:"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/26-7.jpg"><img alt="26-7th.jpg (31K)" src="images/26-7th.jpg" height="476" width="410"></a>

"And meanwhile rest assur'd, that sight in thee<br>
Is but o'erpowered a space, not wholly quench'd:<br>
Since thy fair guide and lovely, in her look<br>
Hath potency, the like to that which dwelt<br>
In Ananias' hand.'' I answering thus:<br>
"Be to mine eyes the remedy or late<br>
Or early, at her pleasure; for they were<br>
The gates, at which she enter'd, and did light<br>
Her never dying fire. &nbsp;My wishes here<br>
Are centered; in this palace is the weal,<br>
That Alpha and Omega, is to all<br>
The lessons love can read me." &nbsp;Yet again<br>
The voice which had dispers'd my fear, when daz'd<br>
With that excess, to converse urg'd, and spake:<br>
"Behooves thee sift more narrowly thy terms,<br>
And say, who level'd at this scope thy bow."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Philosophy," said I, ''hath arguments,<br>
And this place hath authority enough<br>
'T' imprint in me such love: for, of constraint,<br>
Good, inasmuch as we perceive the good,<br>
Kindles our love, and in degree the more,<br>
As it comprises more of goodness in 't.<br>
The essence then, where such advantage is,<br>
That each good, found without it, is naught else<br>
But of his light the beam, must needs attract<br>
The soul of each one, loving, who the truth<br>
Discerns, on which this proof is built. &nbsp;Such truth<br>
Learn I from him, who shows me the first love<br>
Of all intelligential substances<br>
Eternal: from his voice I learn, whose word<br>
Is truth, that of himself to Moses saith,<br>
'I will make all my good before thee pass.'<br>
Lastly from thee I learn, who chief proclaim'st,<br>
E'en at the outset of thy heralding,<br>
In mortal ears the mystery of heav'n."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through human wisdom, and th' authority<br>
Therewith agreeing," heard I answer'd, "keep<br>
The choicest of thy love for God. &nbsp;But say,<br>
If thou yet other cords within thee feel'st<br>
That draw thee towards him; so that thou report<br>
How many are the fangs, with which this love<br>
Is grappled to thy soul." &nbsp;I did not miss,<br>
To what intent the eagle of our Lord<br>
Had pointed his demand; yea noted well<br>
Th' avowal, which he led to; and resum'd:<br>
"All grappling bonds, that knit the heart to God,<br>
Confederate to make fast our clarity.<br>
The being of the world, and mine own being,<br>
The death which he endur'd that I should live,<br>
And that, which all the faithful hope, as I do,<br>
To the foremention'd lively knowledge join'd,<br>
Have from the sea of ill love sav'd my bark,<br>
And on the coast secur'd it of the right.<br>
As for the leaves, that in the garden bloom,<br>
My love for them is great, as is the good<br>
Dealt by th' eternal hand, that tends them all."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ended, and therewith a song most sweet<br>
Rang through the spheres; and "Holy, holy, holy,"<br>
Accordant with the rest my lady sang.<br>
And as a sleep is broken and dispers'd<br>
Through sharp encounter of the nimble light,<br>
With the eye's spirit running forth to meet<br>
The ray, from membrane on to the membrane urg'd;<br>
And the upstartled wight loathes that he sees;<br>
So, at his sudden waking, he misdeems<br>
Of all around him, till assurance waits<br>
On better judgment: thus the saintly came<br>
Drove from before mine eyes the motes away,<br>
With the resplendence of her own, that cast<br>
Their brightness downward, thousand miles below.<br>
Whence I my vision, clearer shall before,<br>
Recover'd; and, well nigh astounded, ask'd<br>
Of a fourth light, that now with us I saw.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Beatrice: "The first diving soul,<br>
That ever the first virtue fram'd, admires<br>
Within these rays his Maker." &nbsp;Like the leaf,<br>
That bows its lithe top till the blast is blown;<br>
By its own virtue rear'd then stands aloof;<br>
So I, the whilst she said, awe-stricken bow'd.<br>
Then eagerness to speak embolden'd me;<br>
And I began: "O fruit! that wast alone<br>
Mature, when first engender'd! &nbsp;Ancient father!<br>
That doubly seest in every wedded bride<br>
Thy daughter by affinity and blood!<br>
Devoutly as I may, I pray thee hold<br>
Converse with me: my will thou seest; and I,<br>
More speedily to hear thee, tell it not."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It chanceth oft some animal bewrays,<br>
Through the sleek cov'ring of his furry coat.<br>
The fondness, that stirs in him and conforms<br>
His outside seeming to the cheer within:<br>
And in like guise was Adam's spirit mov'd<br>
To joyous mood, that through the covering shone,<br>
Transparent, when to pleasure me it spake:<br>
"No need thy will be told, which I untold<br>
Better discern, than thou whatever thing<br>
Thou holdst most certain: for that will I see<br>
In Him, who is truth's mirror, and Himself<br>
Parhelion unto all things, and naught else<br>
To him. &nbsp;This wouldst thou hear; how long since God<br>
Plac'd me high garden, from whose hounds<br>
She led me up in this ladder, steep and long;<br>
What space endur'd my season of delight;<br>
Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish'd me;<br>
And what the language, which I spake and fram'd<br>
Not that I tasted of the tree, my son,<br>
Was in itself the cause of that exile,<br>
But only my transgressing of the mark<br>
Assign'd me. &nbsp;There, whence at thy lady's hest<br>
The Mantuan mov'd him, still was I debarr'd<br>
This council, till the sun had made complete,<br>
Four thousand and three hundred rounds and twice,<br>
His annual journey; and, through every light<br>
In his broad pathway, saw I him return,<br>
Thousand save sev'nty times, the whilst I dwelt<br>
Upon the earth. &nbsp;The language I did use<br>
Was worn away, or ever Nimrod's race<br>
Their unaccomplishable work began.<br>
For naught, that man inclines to, ere was lasting,<br>
Left by his reason free, and variable,<br>
As is the sky that sways him. &nbsp;That he speaks,<br>
Is nature's prompting: whether thus or thus,<br>
She leaves to you, as ye do most affect it.<br>
Ere I descended into hell's abyss,<br>
El was the name on earth of the Chief Good,<br>
Whose joy enfolds me: Eli then 't was call'd<br>
And so beseemeth: for, in mortals, use<br>
Is as the leaf upon the bough; that goes,<br>
And other comes instead. &nbsp;Upon the mount<br>
Most high above the waters, all my life,<br>
Both innocent and guilty, did but reach<br>
From the first hour, to that which cometh next<br>
(As the sun changes quarter), to the sixth."</p>

<p>Then &nbsp;"Glory to the Father, to the Son,<br>
And to the Holy Spirit," rang aloud<br>
Throughout all Paradise, that with the song<br>
My spirit reel'd, so passing sweet the strain:<br>
And what I saw was equal ecstasy;<br>
One universal smile it seem'd of all things,<br>
Joy past compare, gladness unutterable,<br>
Imperishable life of peace and love,<br>
Exhaustless riches and unmeasur'd bliss.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before mine eyes stood the four torches lit;<br>
And that, which first had come, began to wax<br>
In brightness, and in semblance such became,<br>
As Jove might be, if he and Mars were birds,<br>
And interchang'd their plumes. &nbsp;Silence ensued,<br>
Through the blest quire, by Him, who here appoints<br>
Vicissitude of ministry, enjoin'd;<br>
When thus I heard: "Wonder not, if my hue<br>
Be chang'd; for, while I speak, these shalt thou see<br>
All in like manner change with me. &nbsp;My place<br>
He who usurps on earth (my place, ay, mine,<br>
Which in the presence of the Son of God<br>
Is void), the same hath made my cemetery<br>
A common sewer of puddle and of blood:<br>
The more below his triumph, who from hence<br>
Malignant fell." &nbsp;Such colour, as the sun,<br>
At eve or morning, paints an adverse cloud,<br>
Then saw I sprinkled over all the sky.<br>
And as th' unblemish'd dame, who in herself<br>
Secure of censure, yet at bare report<br>
Of other's failing, shrinks with maiden fear;<br>
So Beatrice in her semblance chang'd:<br>
And such eclipse in heav'n methinks was seen,<br>
When the Most Holy suffer'd. &nbsp;Then the words<br>
Proceeded, with voice, alter'd from itself<br>
So clean, the semblance did not alter more.<br>
"Not to this end was Christ's spouse with my blood,<br>
With that of Linus, and of Cletus fed:<br>
That she might serve for purchase of base gold:<br>
But for the purchase of this happy life<br>
Did Sextus, Pius, and Callixtus bleed,<br>
And Urban, they, whose doom was not without<br>
Much weeping seal'd. &nbsp;No purpose was of our<br>
That on the right hand of our successors<br>
Part of the Christian people should be set,<br>
And part upon their left; nor that the keys,<br>
Which were vouchsaf'd me, should for ensign serve<br>
Unto the banners, that do levy war<br>
On the baptiz'd: nor I, for sigil-mark<br>
Set upon sold and lying privileges;<br>
Which makes me oft to bicker and turn red.<br>
In shepherd's clothing greedy wolves below<br>
Range wide o'er all the pastures. &nbsp;Arm of God!<br>
Why longer sleepst thou? &nbsp;Caorsines and Gascona<br>
Prepare to quaff our blood. &nbsp;O good beginning<br>
To what a vile conclusion must thou stoop!<br>
But the high providence, which did defend<br>
Through Scipio the world's glory unto Rome,<br>
Will not delay its succour: and thou, son,<br>
Who through thy mortal weight shall yet again<br>
Return below, open thy lips, nor hide<br>
What is by me not hidden." &nbsp;As a Hood<br>
Of frozen vapours streams adown the air,<br>
What time the she-goat with her skiey horn<br>
Touches the sun; so saw I there stream wide<br>
The vapours, who with us had linger'd late<br>
And with glad triumph deck th' ethereal cope.<br>
Onward my sight their semblances pursued;<br>
So far pursued, as till the space between<br>
From its reach sever'd them: whereat the guide<br>
Celestial, marking me no more intent<br>
On upward gazing, said, "Look down and see<br>
What circuit thou hast compass'd." &nbsp;From the hour<br>
When I before had cast my view beneath,<br>
All the first region overpast I saw,<br>
Which from the midmost to the bound'ry winds;<br>
That onward thence from Gades I beheld<br>
The unwise passage of Laertes' son,<br>
And hitherward the shore, where thou, Europa!<br>
Mad'st thee a joyful burden: and yet more<br>
Of this dim spot had seen, but that the sun,<br>
A constellation off and more, had ta'en<br>
His progress in the zodiac underneath.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then by the spirit, that doth never leave<br>
Its amorous dalliance with my lady's looks,<br>
Back with redoubled ardour were mine eyes<br>
Led unto her: and from her radiant smiles,<br>
Whenas I turn'd me, pleasure so divine<br>
Did lighten on me, that whatever bait<br>
Or art or nature in the human flesh,<br>
Or in its limn'd resemblance, can combine<br>
Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal,<br>
Were to her beauty nothing. &nbsp;Its boon influence<br>
From the fair nest of Leda rapt me forth,<br>
And wafted on into the swiftest heav'n.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What place for entrance Beatrice chose,<br>
I may not say, so uniform was all,<br>
Liveliest and loftiest. &nbsp;She my secret wish<br>
Divin'd; and with such gladness, that God's love<br>
Seem'd from her visage shining, thus began:<br>
"Here is the goal, whence motion on his race<br>
Starts; motionless the centre, and the rest<br>
All mov'd around. &nbsp;Except the soul divine,<br>
Place in this heav'n is none, the soul divine,<br>
Wherein the love, which ruleth o'er its orb,<br>
Is kindled, and the virtue that it sheds;<br>
One circle, light and love, enclasping it,<br>
As this doth clasp the others; and to Him,<br>
Who draws the bound, its limit only known.<br>
Measur'd itself by none, it doth divide<br>
Motion to all, counted unto them forth,<br>
As by the fifth or half ye count forth ten.<br>
The vase, wherein time's roots are plung'd, thou seest,<br>
Look elsewhere for the leaves. &nbsp;O mortal lust!<br>
That canst not lift thy head above the waves<br>
Which whelm and sink thee down! &nbsp;The will in man<br>
Bears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promise<br>
Is, by the dripping of perpetual rain,<br>
Made mere abortion: faith and innocence<br>
Are met with but in babes, each taking leave<br>
Ere cheeks with down are sprinkled; he, that fasts,<br>
While yet a stammerer, with his tongue let loose<br>
Gluts every food alike in every moon.<br>
One yet a babbler, loves and listens to<br>
His mother; but no sooner hath free use<br>
Of speech, than he doth wish her in her grave.<br>
So suddenly doth the fair child of him,<br>
Whose welcome is the morn and eve his parting,<br>
To negro blackness change her virgin white.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou, to abate thy wonder, note that none<br>
Bears rule in earth, and its frail family<br>
Are therefore wand'rers. &nbsp;Yet before the date,<br>
When through the hundredth in his reck'ning drops<br>
Pale January must be shor'd aside<br>
From winter's calendar, these heav'nly spheres<br>
Shall roar so loud, that fortune shall be fain<br>
To turn the poop, where she hath now the prow;<br>
So that the fleet run onward; and true fruit,<br>
Expected long, shall crown at last the bloom!"</p>

<h2>CANTO XXVII</h2>
<br>

<p>So she who doth imparadise my soul,<br>
Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life,<br>
And bar'd the truth of poor mortality;<br>
When lo! as one who, in a mirror, spies<br>
The shining of a flambeau at his back,<br>
Lit sudden ore he deem of its approach,<br>
And turneth to resolve him, if the glass<br>
Have told him true, and sees the record faithful<br>
As note is to its metre; even thus,<br>
I well remember, did befall to me,<br>
Looking upon the beauteous eyes, whence love<br>
Had made the leash to take me. &nbsp;As I turn'd;<br>
And that, which, in their circles, none who spies,<br>
Can miss of, in itself apparent, struck<br>
On mine; a point I saw, that darted light<br>
So sharp, no lid, unclosing, may bear up<br>
Against its keenness. &nbsp;The least star we view<br>
From hence, had seem'd a moon, set by its side,<br>
As star by side of star. &nbsp;And so far off,<br>
Perchance, as is the halo from the light<br>
Which paints it, when most dense the vapour spreads,<br>
There wheel'd about the point a circle of fire,<br>
More rapid than the motion, which first girds<br>
The world. &nbsp;Then, circle after circle, round<br>
Enring'd each other; till the seventh reach'd<br>
Circumference so ample, that its bow,<br>
Within the span of Juno's messenger,<br>
lied scarce been held entire. Beyond the sev'nth,<br>
Follow'd yet other two. &nbsp;And every one,<br>
As more in number distant from the first,<br>
Was tardier in motion; and that glow'd<br>
With flame most pure, that to the sparkle' of truth<br>
Was nearest, as partaking most, methinks,<br>
Of its reality. &nbsp;The guide belov'd<br>
Saw me in anxious thought suspense, and spake:<br>
"Heav'n, and all nature, hangs upon that point.<br>
The circle thereto most conjoin'd observe;<br>
And know, that by intenser love its course<br>
Is to this swiftness wing'd." &nbsp;To whom I thus:<br>
"It were enough; nor should I further seek,<br>
Had I but witness'd order, in the world<br>
Appointed, such as in these wheels is seen.<br>
But in the sensible world such diff'rence is,<br>
That is each round shows more divinity,<br>
As each is wider from the centre. &nbsp;Hence,<br>
If in this wondrous and angelic temple,<br>
That hath for confine only light and love,<br>
My wish may have completion I must know,<br>
Wherefore such disagreement is between<br>
Th' exemplar and its copy: for myself,<br>
Contemplating, I fail to pierce the cause."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is no marvel, if thy fingers foil'd<br>
Do leave the knot untied: so hard 't is grown<br>
For want of tenting." &nbsp;Thus she said: "But take,"<br>
She added, "if thou wish thy cure, my words,<br>
And entertain them subtly. &nbsp;Every orb<br>
Corporeal, doth proportion its extent<br>
Unto the virtue through its parts diffus'd.<br>
The greater blessedness preserves the more.<br>
The greater is the body (if all parts<br>
Share equally) the more is to preserve.<br>
Therefore the circle, whose swift course enwheels<br>
The universal frame answers to that,<br>
Which is supreme in knowledge and in love<br>
Thus by the virtue, not the seeming, breadth<br>
Of substance, measure, thou shalt see the heav'ns,<br>
Each to the' intelligence that ruleth it,<br>
Greater to more, and smaller unto less,<br>
Suited in strict and wondrous harmony."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the sturdy north blows from his cheek<br>
A blast, that scours the sky, forthwith our air,<br>
Clear'd of the rack, that hung on it before,<br>
Glitters; and, With his beauties all unveil'd,<br>
The firmament looks forth serene, and smiles;<br>
Such was my cheer, when Beatrice drove<br>
With clear reply the shadows back, and truth<br>
Was manifested, as a star in heaven.<br>
And when the words were ended, not unlike<br>
To iron in the furnace, every cirque<br>
Ebullient shot forth scintillating fires:<br>
And every sparkle shivering to new blaze,<br>
In number did outmillion the account<br>
Reduplicate upon the chequer'd board.<br>
Then heard I echoing on from choir to choir,<br>
"Hosanna," to the fixed point, that holds,<br>
And shall for ever hold them to their place,<br>
From everlasting, irremovable.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musing awhile I stood: and she, who saw<br>
by inward meditations, thus began:<br>
"In the first circles, they, whom thou beheldst,<br>
Are seraphim and cherubim. &nbsp;Thus swift<br>
Follow their hoops, in likeness to the point,<br>
Near as they can, approaching; and they can<br>
The more, the loftier their vision. &nbsp;Those,<br>
That round them fleet, gazing the Godhead next,<br>
Are thrones; in whom the first trine ends. &nbsp;And all<br>
Are blessed, even as their sight descends<br>
Deeper into the truth, wherein rest is<br>
For every mind. &nbsp;Thus happiness hath root<br>
In seeing, not in &nbsp;loving, which of sight<br>
Is aftergrowth. &nbsp;And of the seeing such<br>
The meed, as unto each in due degree<br>
Grace and good-will their measure have assign'd.<br>
The other trine, that with still opening buds<br>
In this eternal springtide blossom fair,<br>
Fearless of bruising from the nightly ram,<br>
Breathe up in warbled melodies threefold<br>
Hosannas blending ever, from the three<br>
Transmitted. hierarchy of gods, for aye<br>
Rejoicing, dominations first, next then<br>
Virtues, and powers the third. &nbsp;The next to whom<br>
Are princedoms and archangels, with glad round<br>
To tread their festal ring; and last the band<br>
Angelical, disporting in their sphere.<br>
All, as they circle in their orders, look<br>
Aloft, and downward with such sway prevail,<br>
That all with mutual impulse tend to God.<br>
These once a mortal view beheld. &nbsp;Desire<br>
In Dionysius so intently wrought,<br>
That he, as I have done rang'd them; and nam'd<br>
Their orders, marshal'd in his thought. &nbsp;From him<br>
Dissentient, one refus'd his sacred read.<br>
But soon as in this heav'n his doubting eyes<br>
Were open'd, Gregory at his error smil'd<br>
Nor marvel, that a denizen of earth<br>
Should scan such secret truth; for he had learnt<br>
Both this and much beside of these our orbs,<br>
From an eye-witness to heav'n's mysteries."</p>

<h2>CANTO XXIX</h2>
<br>

<p>No longer than what time Latona's twins<br>
Cover'd of Libra and the fleecy star,<br>
Together both, girding the' horizon hang,<br>
In even balance from the zenith pois'd,<br>
Till from that verge, each, changing hemisphere,<br>
Part the nice level; e'en so brief a space<br>
Did Beatrice's silence hold. &nbsp;A smile<br>
Bat painted on her cheek; and her fix'd gaze<br>
Bent on the point, at which my vision fail'd:<br>
When thus her words resuming she began:<br>
"I speak, nor what thou wouldst inquire demand;<br>
For I have mark'd it, where all time and place<br>
Are present. &nbsp;Not for increase to himself<br>
Of good, which may not be increas'd, but forth<br>
To manifest his glory by its beams,<br>
Inhabiting his own eternity,<br>
Beyond time's limit or what bound soe'er<br>
To circumscribe his being, as he will'd,<br>
Into new natures, like unto himself,<br>
Eternal Love unfolded. &nbsp;Nor before,<br>
As if in dull inaction torpid lay.<br>
For not in process of before or aft<br>
Upon these waters mov'd the Spirit of God.<br>
Simple and mix'd, both form and substance, forth<br>
To perfect being started, like three darts<br>
Shot from a bow three-corded. &nbsp;And as ray<br>
In crystal, glass, and amber, shines entire,<br>
E'en at the moment of its issuing; thus<br>
Did, from th' eternal Sovran, beam entire<br>
His threefold operation, at one act<br>
Produc'd coeval. &nbsp;Yet in order each<br>
Created his due station knew: those highest,<br>
Who pure intelligence were made: mere power<br>
The lowest: in the midst, bound with strict league,<br>
Intelligence and power, unsever'd bond.<br>
Long tract of ages by the angels past,<br>
Ere the creating of another world,<br>
Describ'd on Jerome's pages thou hast seen.<br>
But that what I disclose to thee is true,<br>
Those penmen, whom the Holy Spirit mov'd<br>
In many a passage of their sacred book<br>
Attest; as thou by diligent search shalt find<br>
And reason in some sort discerns the same,<br>
Who scarce would grant the heav'nly ministers<br>
Of their perfection void, so long a space.<br>
Thus when and where these spirits of love were made,<br>
Thou know'st, and how: and knowing hast allay'd<br>
Thy thirst, which from the triple question rose.<br>
Ere one had reckon'd twenty, e'en so soon<br>
Part of the angels fell: and in their fall<br>
Confusion to your elements ensued.<br>
The others kept their station: and this task,<br>
Whereon thou lookst, began with such delight,<br>
That they surcease not ever, day nor night,<br>
Their circling. &nbsp;Of that fatal lapse the cause<br>
Was the curst pride of him, whom thou hast seen<br>
Pent with the world's incumbrance. &nbsp;Those, whom here<br>
Thou seest, were lowly to confess themselves<br>
Of his free bounty, who had made them apt<br>
For ministries so high: therefore their views<br>
Were by enlight'ning grace and their own merit<br>
Exalted; so that in their will confirm'd<br>
They stand, nor feel to fall. &nbsp;For do not doubt,<br>
But to receive the grace, which heav'n vouchsafes,<br>
Is meritorious, even as the soul<br>
With prompt affection welcometh the guest.<br>
Now, without further help, if with good heed<br>
My words thy mind have treasur'd, thou henceforth<br>
This consistory round about mayst scan,<br>
And gaze thy fill. &nbsp;But since thou hast on earth<br>
Heard vain disputers, reasoners in the schools,<br>
Canvas the' angelic nature, and dispute<br>
Its powers of apprehension, memory, choice;<br>
Therefore, 't is well thou take from me the truth,<br>
Pure and without disguise, which they below,<br>
Equivocating, darken and perplex.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know thou, that, from the first, these substances,<br>
Rejoicing in the countenance of God,<br>
Have held unceasingly their view, intent<br>
Upon the glorious vision, from the which<br>
Naught absent is nor hid: where then no change<br>
Of newness with succession interrupts,<br>
Remembrance there needs none to gather up<br>
Divided thought and images remote<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So that men, thus at variance with the truth<br>
Dream, though their eyes be open; reckless some<br>
Of error; others well aware they err,<br>
To whom more guilt and shame are justly due.<br>
Each the known track of sage philosophy<br>
Deserts, and has a byway of his own:<br>
So much the restless eagerness to shine<br>
And love of singularity prevail.<br>
Yet this, offensive as it is, provokes<br>
Heav'n's anger less, than when the book of God<br>
Is forc'd to yield to man's authority,<br>
Or from its straightness warp'd: no reck'ning made<br>
What blood the sowing of it in the world<br>
Has cost; what favour for himself he wins,<br>
Who meekly clings to it. &nbsp;The aim of all<br>
Is how to shine: e'en they, whose office is<br>
To preach the Gospel, let the gospel sleep,<br>
And pass their own inventions off instead.<br>
One tells, how at Christ's suffering the wan moon<br>
Bent back her steps, and shadow'd o'er the sun<br>
With intervenient disk, as she withdrew:<br>
Another, how the light shrouded itself<br>
Within its tabernacle, and left dark<br>
The Spaniard and the Indian, with the Jew.<br>
Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears,<br>
Bandied about more frequent, than the names<br>
Of Bindi and of Lapi in her streets.<br>
The sheep, meanwhile, poor witless ones, return<br>
From pasture, fed with wind: and what avails<br>
For their excuse, they do not see their harm?<br>
Christ said not to his first conventicle,<br>
'Go forth and preach impostures to the world,'<br>
But gave them truth to build on; and the sound<br>
Was mighty on their lips; nor needed they,<br>
Beside the gospel, other spear or shield,<br>
To aid them in their warfare for the faith.<br>
The preacher now provides himself with store<br>
Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack<br>
Of laughter, while he vents them, his big cowl<br>
Distends, and he has won the meed he sought:<br>
Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while<br>
Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood,<br>
They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said.<br>
Which now the dotards hold in such esteem,<br>
That every counterfeit, who spreads abroad<br>
The hands of holy promise, finds a throng<br>
Of credulous fools beneath. &nbsp;Saint Anthony<br>
Fattens with this his swine, and others worse<br>
Than swine, who diet at his lazy board,<br>
Paying with unstamp'd metal for their fare.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But (for we far have wander'd) let us seek<br>
The forward path again; so as the way<br>
Be shorten'd with the time. &nbsp;No mortal tongue<br>
Nor thought of man hath ever reach'd so far,<br>
That of these natures he might count the tribes.<br>
What Daniel of their thousands hath reveal'd<br>
With finite number infinite conceals.<br>
The fountain at whose source these drink their beams,<br>
With light supplies them in as many modes,<br>
As there are splendours, that it shines on: each<br>
According to the virtue it conceives,<br>
Differing in love and sweet affection.<br>
Look then how lofty and how huge in breadth<br>
The' eternal might, which, broken and dispers'd<br>
Over such countless mirrors, yet remains<br>
Whole in itself and one, as at the first."</p>

<h2>CANTO XXX</h2>
<br>

<p>Noon's fervid hour perchance six thousand miles<br>
From hence is distant; and the shadowy cone<br>
Almost to level on our earth declines;<br>
When from the midmost of this blue abyss<br>
By turns some star is to our vision lost.<br>
And straightway as the handmaid of the sun<br>
Puts forth her radiant brow, all, light by light,<br>
Fade, and the spangled firmament shuts in,<br>
E'en to the loveliest of the glittering throng.<br>
Thus vanish'd gradually from my sight<br>
The triumph, which plays ever round the point,<br>
That overcame me, seeming (for it did)<br>
Engirt by that it girdeth. &nbsp;Wherefore love,<br>
With loss of other object, forc'd me bend<br>
Mine eyes on Beatrice once again.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all, that hitherto is told of her,<br>
Were in one praise concluded, 't were too weak<br>
To furnish out this turn. &nbsp;Mine eyes did look<br>
On beauty, such, as I believe in sooth,<br>
Not merely to exceed our human, but,<br>
That save its Maker, none can to the full<br>
Enjoy it. &nbsp;At this point o'erpower'd I fail,<br>
Unequal to my theme, as never bard<br>
Of buskin or of sock hath fail'd before.<br>
For, as the sun doth to the feeblest sight,<br>
E'en so remembrance of that witching smile<br>
Hath dispossess my spirit of itself.<br>
Not from that day, when on this earth I first<br>
Beheld her charms, up to that view of them,<br>
Have I with song applausive ever ceas'd<br>
To follow, but not follow them no more;<br>
My course here bounded, as each artist's is,<br>
When it doth touch the limit of his skill.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She (such as I bequeath her to the bruit<br>
Of louder trump than mine, which hasteneth on,<br>
Urging its arduous matter to the close),<br>
Her words resum'd, in gesture and in voice<br>
Resembling one accustom'd to command:<br>
"Forth from the last corporeal are we come<br>
Into the heav'n, that is unbodied light,<br>
Light intellectual replete with love,<br>
Love of true happiness replete with joy,<br>
Joy, that transcends all sweetness of delight.<br>
Here shalt thou look on either mighty host<br>
Of Paradise; and one in that array,<br>
Which in the final judgment thou shalt see."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when the lightning, in a sudden spleen<br>
Unfolded, dashes from the blinding eyes<br>
The visive spirits dazzled and bedimm'd;<br>
So, round about me, fulminating streams<br>
Of living radiance play'd, and left me swath'd<br>
And veil'd in dense impenetrable blaze.<br>
Such weal is in the love, that stills this heav'n;<br>
For its own flame the torch this fitting ever!<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner to my list'ning ear had come<br>
The brief assurance, than I understood<br>
New virtue into me infus'd, and sight<br>
Kindled afresh, with vigour to sustain<br>
Excess of light, however pure. &nbsp;I look'd;<br>
And in the likeness of a river saw<br>
Light flowing, from whose amber-seeming waves<br>
Flash'd up effulgence, as they glided on<br>
'Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring,<br>
Incredible how fair; and, from the tide,<br>
There ever and anon, outstarting, flew<br>
Sparkles instinct with life; and in the flow'rs<br>
Did set them, like to rubies chas'd in gold;<br>
Then, as if drunk with odors, plung'd again<br>
Into the wondrous flood; from which, as one<br>
Re'enter'd, still another rose. &nbsp;"The thirst<br>
Of knowledge high, whereby thou art inflam'd,<br>
To search the meaning of what here thou seest,<br>
The more it warms thee, pleases me the more.<br>
But first behooves thee of this water drink,<br>
Or ere that longing be allay'd." &nbsp;So spake<br>
The day-star of mine eyes; then thus subjoin'd:<br>
"This stream, and these, forth issuing from its gulf,<br>
And diving back, a living topaz each,<br>
With all this laughter on its bloomy shores,<br>
Are but a preface, shadowy of the truth<br>
They emblem: not that, in themselves, the things<br>
Are crude; but on thy part is the defect,<br>
For that thy views not yet aspire so high."<br>
Never did babe, that had outslept his wont,<br>
Rush, with such eager straining, to the milk,<br>
As I toward the water, bending me,<br>
To make the better mirrors of mine eyes<br>
In the refining wave; and, as the eaves<br>
Of mine eyelids did drink of it, forthwith<br>
Seem'd it unto me turn'd from length to round,<br>
Then as a troop of maskers, when they put<br>
Their vizors off, look other than before,<br>
The counterfeited semblance thrown aside;<br>
So into greater jubilee were chang'd<br>
Those flowers and sparkles, and distinct I saw<br>
Before me either court of heav'n displac'd.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O prime enlightener! thou who crav'st me strength<br>
On the high triumph of thy realm to gaze!<br>
Grant virtue now to utter what I kenn'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is in heav'n a light, whose goodly shine<br>
Makes the Creator visible to all<br>
Created, that in seeing him alone<br>
Have peace; and in a circle spreads so far,<br>
That the circumference were too loose a zone<br>
To girdle in the sun. &nbsp;All is one beam,<br>
Reflected from the summit of the first,<br>
That moves, which being hence and vigour takes,<br>
And as some cliff, that from the bottom eyes<br>
Its image mirror'd in the crystal flood,<br>
As if 't admire its brave appareling<br>
Of verdure and of flowers: so, round about,<br>
Eyeing the light, on more than million thrones,<br>
Stood, eminent, whatever from our earth<br>
Has to the skies return'd. &nbsp;How wide the leaves<br>
Extended to their utmost of this rose,<br>
Whose lowest step embosoms such a space<br>
Of ample radiance! &nbsp;Yet, nor amplitude<br>
Nor height impeded, but my view with ease<br>
Took in the full dimensions of that joy.<br>
Near or remote, what there avails, where God<br>
Immediate rules, and Nature, awed, suspends<br>
Her sway? &nbsp;Into the yellow of the rose<br>
Perennial, which in bright expansiveness,<br>
Lays forth its gradual blooming, redolent<br>
Of praises to the never-wint'ring sun,<br>
As one, who fain would speak yet holds his peace,<br>
Beatrice led me; and, "Behold," she said,<br>
"This fair assemblage! stoles of snowy white<br>
How numberless! &nbsp;The city, where we dwell,<br>
Behold how vast! and these our seats so throng'd<br>
Few now are wanting here! &nbsp;In that proud stall,<br>
On which, the crown, already o'er its state<br>
Suspended, holds thine eyes&mdash;or ere thyself<br>
Mayst at the wedding sup,&mdash;shall rest the soul<br>
Of the great Harry, he who, by the world<br>
Augustas hail'd, to Italy must come,<br>
Before her day be ripe. &nbsp;But ye are sick,<br>
And in your tetchy wantonness as blind,<br>
As is the bantling, that of hunger dies,<br>
And drives away the nurse. &nbsp;Nor may it be,<br>
That he, who in the sacred forum sways,<br>
Openly or in secret, shall with him<br>
Accordant walk: Whom God will not endure<br>
I' th' holy office long; but thrust him down<br>
To Simon Magus, where Magna's priest<br>
Will sink beneath him: such will be his meed."</p>

<p>In fashion, as a snow-white rose, lay then<br>
Before my view the saintly multitude,<br>
Which in his own blood Christ espous'd. &nbsp;Meanwhile<br>
That other host, that soar aloft to gaze<br>
And celebrate his glory, whom they love,<br>
Hover'd around; and, like a troop of bees,<br>
Amid the vernal sweets alighting now,<br>
Now, clustering, where their fragrant labour glows,<br>
Flew downward to the mighty flow'r, or rose<br>
From the redundant petals, streaming back<br>
Unto the steadfast dwelling of their joy.<br>
Faces had they of flame, and wings of gold;<br>
The rest was whiter than the driven snow.<br>
And as they flitted down into the flower,<br>
From range to range, fanning their plumy loins,<br>
Whisper'd the peace and ardour, which they won<br>
From that soft winnowing. &nbsp;Shadow none, the vast<br>
Interposition of such numerous flight<br>
Cast, from above, upon the flower, or view<br>
Obstructed aught. &nbsp;For, through the universe,<br>
Wherever merited, celestial light<br>
Glides freely, and no obstacle prevents.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All there, who reign in safety and in bliss,<br>
Ages long past or new, on one sole mark<br>
Their love and vision fix'd. &nbsp;O trinal beam<br>
Of individual star, that charmst them thus,<br>
Vouchsafe one glance to gild our storm below!<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the grim brood, from Arctic shores that roam'd,<br>
(Where helice, forever, as she wheels,<br>
Sparkles a mother's fondness on her son)<br>
Stood in mute wonder 'mid the works of Rome,<br>
When to their view the Lateran arose<br>
In greatness more than earthly; I, who then<br>
From human to divine had past, from time<br>
Unto eternity, and out of Florence<br>
To justice and to truth, how might I choose<br>
But marvel too? &nbsp;'Twixt gladness and amaze,<br>
In sooth no will had I to utter aught,<br>
Or hear. &nbsp;And, as a pilgrim, when he rests<br>
Within the temple of his vow, looks round<br>
In breathless awe, and hopes some time to tell<br>
Of all its goodly state: e'en so mine eyes<br>
Cours'd up and down along the living light,<br>
Now low, and now aloft, and now around,<br>
Visiting every step. &nbsp;Looks I beheld,<br>
Where charity in soft persuasion sat,<br>
Smiles from within and radiance from above,<br>
And in each gesture grace and honour high.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So rov'd my ken, and its general form<br>
All Paradise survey'd: when round I turn'd<br>
With purpose of my lady to inquire<br>
Once more of things, that held my thought suspense,<br>
But answer found from other than I ween'd;<br>
For, Beatrice, when I thought to see,<br>
I saw instead a senior, at my side,<br>
&nbsp;Rob'd, as the rest, in glory. &nbsp;Joy benign<br>
Glow'd in his eye, and o'er his cheek diffus'd,<br>
With gestures such as spake a father's love.<br>
And, "Whither is she vanish'd?" &nbsp;straight I ask'd.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By Beatrice summon'd," he replied,<br>
"I come to aid thy wish. &nbsp;Looking aloft<br>
To the third circle from the highest, there<br>
Behold her on the throne, wherein her merit<br>
Hath plac'd her." &nbsp;Answering not, mine eyes I rais'd,<br>
And saw her, where aloof she sat, her brow<br>
A wreath reflecting of eternal beams.<br>
Not from the centre of the sea so far<br>
Unto the region of the highest thunder,<br>
As was my ken from hers; and yet the form<br>
Came through that medium down, unmix'd and pure,<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Lady! thou in whom my hopes have rest!<br>
Who, for my safety, hast not scorn'd, in hell<br>
To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark'd!<br>
For all mine eyes have seen, I, to thy power<br>
And goodness, virtue owe and grace. &nbsp;Of slave,<br>
Thou hast to freedom brought me; and no means,<br>
For my deliverance apt, hast left untried.<br>
Thy liberal bounty still toward me keep.<br>
That, when my spirit, which thou madest whole,<br>
Is loosen'd from this body, it may find<br>
Favour with thee." &nbsp;So I my suit preferr'd:<br>
And she, so distant, as appear'd, look'd down,<br>
And smil'd; then tow'rds th' eternal fountain turn'd.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus the senior, holy and rever'd:<br>
"That thou at length mayst happily conclude<br>
Thy voyage (to which end I was dispatch'd,<br>
By supplication mov'd and holy love)<br>
Let thy upsoaring vision range, at large,<br>
This garden through: for so, by ray divine<br>
Kindled, thy ken a higher flight shall mount;<br>
And from heav'n's queen, whom fervent I adore,<br>
All gracious aid befriend us; for that I<br>
Am her own faithful Bernard." &nbsp;Like a wight,<br>
Who haply from Croatia wends to see<br>
Our Veronica, and the while 't is shown,<br>
Hangs over it with never-sated gaze,<br>
And, all that he hath heard revolving, saith<br>
Unto himself in thought: "And didst thou look<br>
E'en thus, O Jesus, my true Lord and God?<br>
And was this semblance thine?" &nbsp;So gaz'd I then<br>
Adoring; for the charity of him,<br>
Who musing, in the world that peace enjoy'd,<br>
Stood lively before me. &nbsp;"Child of grace!"<br>
Thus he began: "thou shalt not knowledge gain<br>
Of this glad being, if thine eyes are held<br>
Still in this depth below. &nbsp;But search around<br>
The circles, to the furthest, till thou spy<br>
Seated in state, the queen, that of this realm<br>
Is sovran." &nbsp;Straight mine eyes I rais'd; and bright,<br>
As, at the birth of morn, the eastern clime<br>
Above th' horizon, where the sun declines;<br>
To mine eyes, that upward, as from vale<br>
To mountain sped, at th' extreme bound, a part<br>
Excell'd in lustre all the front oppos'd.<br>
And as the glow burns ruddiest o'er the wave,<br>
That waits the sloping beam, which Phaeton<br>
Ill knew to guide, and on each part the light<br>
Diminish'd fades, intensest in the midst;<br>
So burn'd the peaceful oriflame, and slack'd<br>
On every side the living flame decay'd.<br>
And in that midst their sportive pennons wav'd<br>
Thousands of angels; in resplendence each<br>
Distinct, and quaint adornment. At their glee<br>
And carol, smil'd the Lovely One of heav'n,<br>
That joy was in the eyes of all the blest.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich,<br>
As is the colouring in fancy's loom,<br>
'T were all too poor to utter the least part<br>
Of that enchantment. &nbsp;When he saw mine eyes<br>
Intent on her, that charm'd him, Bernard gaz'd<br>
With so exceeding fondness, as infus'd<br>
Ardour into my breast, unfelt before.</p>

The third in order, underneath her, lo!<br>
Rachel with Beatrice. Sarah next,<br>
Judith, Rebecca, and the gleaner maid,<br>
Meek ancestress of him, who sang the songs<br>
Of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood.<br>
All, as I name them, down from deaf to leaf,<br>
Are in gradation throned on the rose.<br>
And from the seventh step, successively,<br>
Adown the breathing tresses of the flow'r<br>
Still doth the file of Hebrew dames proceed.<br>
For these are a partition wall, whereby<br>
The sacred stairs are sever'd, as the faith<br>
In Christ divides them. &nbsp;On this part, where blooms<br>
Each leaf in full maturity, are set<br>
Such as in Christ, or ere he came, believ'd.<br>
On th' other, where an intersected space<br>
Yet shows the semicircle void, abide<br>
All they, who look'd to Christ already come.<br>
And as our Lady on her glorious stool,<br>
And they who on their stools beneath her sit,<br>
This way distinction make: e'en so on his,<br>
The mighty Baptist that way marks the line<br>
(He who endur'd the desert and the pains<br>
Of martyrdom, and for two years of hell,<br>
Yet still continued holy), and beneath,<br>
Augustin, Francis, Benedict, and the rest,<br>
Thus far from round to round. &nbsp;So heav'n's decree<br>
Forecasts, this garden equally to fill.<br>
With faith in either view, past or to come,<br>
Learn too, that downward from the step, which cleaves<br>
Midway the twain compartments, none there are<br>
Who place obtain for merit of their own,<br>
But have through others' merit been advanc'd,<br>
On set conditions: spirits all releas'd,<br>
Ere for themselves they had the power to choose.<br>
And, if thou mark and listen to them well,<br>
Their childish looks and voice declare as much.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here, silent as thou art, I know thy doubt;<br>
And gladly will I loose the knot, wherein<br>
Thy subtle thoughts have bound thee. &nbsp;From this realm<br>
Excluded, chalice no entrance here may find,<br>
No more shall hunger, thirst, or sorrow can.<br>
A law immutable hath establish'd all;<br>
Nor is there aught thou seest, that doth not fit,<br>
Exactly, as the finger to the ring.<br>
It is not therefore without cause, that these,<br>
O'erspeedy comers to immortal life,<br>
Are different in their shares of excellence.<br>
Our Sovran Lord&mdash;that settleth this estate<br>
In love and in delight so absolute,<br>
That wish can dare no further&mdash;every soul,<br>
Created in his joyous sight to dwell,<br>
With grace at pleasure variously endows.<br>
And for a proof th' effect may well suffice.<br>
And 't is moreover most expressly mark'd<br>
In holy scripture, where the twins are said<br>
To, have struggled in the womb. &nbsp;Therefore, as grace<br>
Inweaves the coronet, so every brow<br>
Weareth its proper hue of orient light.<br>
And merely in respect to his prime gift,<br>
Not in reward of meritorious deed,<br>
Hath each his several degree assign'd.<br>
In early times with their own innocence<br>
More was not wanting, than the parents' faith,<br>
To save them: those first ages past, behoov'd<br>
That circumcision in the males should imp<br>
The flight of innocent wings: but since the day<br>
Of grace hath come, without baptismal rites<br>
In Christ accomplish'd, innocence herself<br>
Must linger yet below. &nbsp;Now raise thy view<br>
Unto the visage most resembling Christ:<br>
For, in her splendour only, shalt thou win<br>
The pow'r to look on him." &nbsp;Forthwith I saw<br>
Such floods of gladness on her visage shower'd,<br>
From holy spirits, winging that profound;<br>
That, whatsoever I had yet beheld,<br>
Had not so much suspended me with wonder,<br>
Or shown me such similitude of God.<br>
And he, who had to her descended, once,<br>
On earth, now hail'd in heav'n; and on pois'd wing.<br>
"Ave, Maria, Gratia Plena," sang:<br>
To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court,<br>
From all parts answ'ring, rang: that holier joy<br>
Brooded the deep serene. &nbsp;"Father rever'd:<br>
Who deign'st, for me, to quit the pleasant place,<br>
Wherein thou sittest, by eternal lot!<br>
Say, who that angel is, that with such glee<br>
Beholds our queen, and so enamour'd glows<br>
Of her high beauty, that all fire he seems."<br>
So I again resorted to the lore<br>
Of my wise teacher, he, whom Mary's charms<br>
Embellish'd, as the sun the morning star;<br>
Who thus in answer spake: "In him are summ'd,<br>
Whatever of buxomness and free delight<br>
May be in Spirit, or in angel, met:<br>
And so beseems: for that he bare the palm<br>
Down unto Mary, when the Son of God<br>
Vouchsaf'd to clothe him in terrestrial weeds.<br>
Now let thine eyes wait heedful on my words,<br>
And note thou of this just and pious realm<br>
The chiefest nobles. &nbsp;Those, highest in bliss,<br>
The twain, on each hand next our empress thron'd,<br>
Are as it were two roots unto this rose.<br>
He to the left, the parent, whose rash taste<br>
Proves bitter to his seed; and, on the right,<br>
That ancient father of the holy church,<br>
Into whose keeping Christ did give the keys<br>
Of this sweet flow'r: near whom behold the seer,<br>
That, ere he died, saw all the grievous times<br>
Of the fair bride, who with the lance and nails<br>
Was won. &nbsp;And, near unto the other, rests<br>
The leader, under whom on manna fed<br>
Th' ungrateful nation, fickle and perverse.<br>
On th' other part, facing to Peter, lo!<br>
Where Anna sits, so well content to look<br>
On her lov'd daughter, that with moveless eye<br>
She chants the loud hosanna: while, oppos'd<br>
To the first father of your mortal kind,<br>
Is Lucia, at whose hest thy lady sped,<br>
When on the edge of ruin clos'd thine eye.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But (for the vision hasteneth so an end)<br>
Here break we off, as the good workman doth,<br>
That shapes the cloak according to the cloth:<br>
And to the primal love our ken shall rise;<br>
That thou mayst penetrate the brightness, far<br>
As sight can bear thee. &nbsp;Yet, alas! in sooth<br>
Beating thy pennons, thinking to advance,<br>
Thou backward fall'st. &nbsp;Grace then must first be gain'd;<br>
Her grace, whose might can help thee. &nbsp;Thou in prayer<br>
Seek her: and, with affection, whilst I sue,<br>
Attend, and yield me all thy heart." &nbsp;He said,<br>
And thus the saintly orison began.</p>

<h2>CANTO XXXIII</h2>
<br>

<p>"O virgin mother, daughter of thy Son,<br>
Created beings all in lowliness<br>
Surpassing, as in height, above them all,<br>
Term by th' eternal counsel pre-ordain'd,<br>
Ennobler of thy nature, so advanc'd<br>
In thee, that its great Maker did not scorn,<br>
Himself, in his own work enclos'd to dwell!<br>
For in thy womb rekindling shone the love<br>
Reveal'd, whose genial influence makes now<br>
This flower to germin in eternal peace!<br>
Here thou to us, of charity and love,<br>
Art, as the noon-day torch: and art, beneath,<br>
To mortal men, of hope a living spring.<br>
So mighty art thou, lady! and so great,<br>
That he who grace desireth, and comes not<br>
To thee for aidance, fain would have desire<br>
Fly without wings. &nbsp;Nor only him who asks,<br>
Thy bounty succours, but doth freely oft<br>
Forerun the asking. &nbsp;Whatsoe'er may be<br>
Of excellence in creature, pity mild,<br>
Relenting mercy, large munificence,<br>
Are all combin'd in thee. &nbsp;Here kneeleth one,<br>
Who of all spirits hath review'd the state,<br>
From the world's lowest gap unto this height.<br>
Suppliant to thee he kneels, imploring grace<br>
For virtue, yet more high to lift his ken<br>
Toward the bliss supreme. &nbsp;And I, who ne'er<br>
Coveted sight, more fondly, for myself,<br>
Than now for him, my prayers to thee prefer,<br>
(And pray they be not scant) that thou wouldst drive<br>
Each cloud of his mortality away;<br>
That on the sovran pleasure he may gaze.<br>
This also I entreat of thee, O queen!<br>
Who canst do what thou wilt! that in him thou<br>
Wouldst after all he hath beheld, preserve<br>
Affection sound, and human passions quell.<br>
Lo! &nbsp;Where, with Beatrice, many a saint<br>
Stretch their clasp'd hands, in furtherance of my suit!"<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes, that heav'n with love and awe regards,<br>
Fix'd on the suitor, witness'd, how benign<br>
She looks on pious pray'rs: then fasten'd they<br>
On th' everlasting light, wherein no eye<br>
Of creature, as may well be thought, so far<br>
Can travel inward. &nbsp;I, meanwhile, who drew<br>
Near to the limit, where all wishes end,<br>
The ardour of my wish (for so behooved),<br>
Ended within me. Beck'ning smil'd the sage,<br>
That I should look aloft: but, ere he bade,<br>
Already of myself aloft I look'd;<br>
For visual strength, refining more and more,<br>
Bare me into the ray authentical<br>
Of sovran light. &nbsp;Thenceforward, what I saw,<br>
Was not for words to speak, nor memory's self<br>
To stand against such outrage on her skill.<br>
As one, who from a dream awaken'd, straight,<br>
All he hath seen forgets; yet still retains<br>
Impression of the feeling in his dream;<br>
E'en such am I: for all the vision dies,<br>
As 't were, away; and yet the sense of sweet,<br>
That sprang from it, still trickles in my heart.<br>
Thus in the sun-thaw is the snow unseal'd;<br>
Thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost<br>
The Sybil's sentence. &nbsp;O eternal beam!<br>
(Whose height what reach of mortal thought may soar?)<br>
Yield me again some little particle<br>
Of what thou then appearedst, give my tongue<br>
Power, but to leave one sparkle of thy glory,<br>
Unto the race to come, that shall not lose<br>
Thy triumph wholly, if thou waken aught<br>
Of memory in me, and endure to hear<br>
The record sound in this unequal strain.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such keenness from the living ray I met,<br>
That, if mine eyes had turn'd away, methinks,<br>
I had been lost; but, so embolden'd, on<br>
I pass'd, as I remember, till my view<br>
Hover'd the brink of dread infinitude.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O grace! unenvying of thy boon! that gav'st<br>
Boldness to fix so earnestly my ken<br>
On th' everlasting splendour, that I look'd,<br>
While sight was unconsum'd, and, in that depth,<br>
Saw in one volume clasp'd of love, whatever<br>
The universe unfolds; all properties<br>
Of substance and of accident, beheld,<br>
Compounded, yet one individual light<br>
The whole. &nbsp;And of such bond methinks I saw<br>
The universal form: for that whenever<br>
I do but speak of it, my soul dilates<br>
Beyond her proper self; and, till I speak,<br>
One moment seems a longer lethargy,<br>
Than five-and-twenty ages had appear'd<br>
To that emprize, that first made Neptune wonder<br>
At Argo's shadow darkening on his flood.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fixed heed, suspense and motionless,<br>
Wond'ring I gaz'd; and admiration still<br>
Was kindled, as I gaz'd. &nbsp;It may not be,<br>
That one, who looks upon that light, can turn<br>
To other object, willingly, his view.<br>
For all the good, that will may covet, there<br>
Is summ'd; and all, elsewhere defective found,<br>
Complete. &nbsp;My tongue shall utter now, no more<br>
E'en what remembrance keeps, than could the babe's<br>
That yet is moisten'd at his mother's breast.<br>
Not that the semblance of the living light<br>
Was chang'd (that ever as at first remain'd)<br>
But that my vision quickening, in that sole<br>
Appearance, still new miracles descry'd,<br>
And toil'd me with the change. &nbsp;In that abyss<br>
Of radiance, clear and lofty, seem'd methought,<br>
Three orbs of triple hue clipt in one bound:<br>
And, from another, one reflected seem'd,<br>
As rainbow is from rainbow: and the third<br>
Seem'd fire, breath'd equally from both. &nbsp;Oh speech<br>
How feeble and how faint art thou, to give<br>
Conception birth! &nbsp;Yet this to what I saw<br>
Is less than little. &nbsp;Oh eternal light!<br>
Sole in thyself that dwellst; and of thyself<br>
Sole understood, past, present, or to come!<br>
Thou smiledst; on that circling, which in thee<br>
Seem'd as reflected splendour, while I mus'd;<br>
For I therein, methought, in its own hue<br>
Beheld our image painted: steadfastly<br>
I therefore por'd upon the view. &nbsp;As one<br>
Who vers'd in geometric lore, would fain<br>
Measure the circle; and, though pondering long<br>
And deeply, that beginning, which he needs,<br>
Finds not; e'en such was I, intent to scan<br>
The novel wonder, and trace out the form,<br>
How to the circle fitted, and therein<br>
How plac'd: but the flight was not for my wing;<br>
Had not a flash darted athwart my mind,<br>
And in the spleen unfolded what it sought.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here vigour fail'd the tow'ring fantasy:<br>
But yet the will roll'd onward, like a wheel<br>
In even motion, by the Love impell'd,<br>
That moves the sun in heav'n and all the stars.</p>
