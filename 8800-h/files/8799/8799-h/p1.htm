<h2>CANTO I</h2>
<br>
<p>His glory, by whose might all things are mov'd,<br>
Pierces the universe, and in one part<br>
Sheds more resplendence, elsewhere less. &nbsp;In heav'n,<br>
That largeliest of his light partakes, was I,<br>
Witness of things, which to relate again<br>
Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence;<br>
For that, so near approaching its desire<br>
Our intellect is to such depth absorb'd,<br>
That memory cannot follow. &nbsp;Nathless all,<br>
That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm<br>
Could store, shall now be matter of my song.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benign Apollo! this last labour aid,<br>
And make me such a vessel of thy worth,<br>
As thy own laurel claims of me belov'd.<br>
Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus' brows<br>
Suffic'd me; henceforth there is need of both<br>
For my remaining enterprise Do thou<br>
Enter into my bosom, and there breathe<br>
So, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg'd<br>
Forth from his limbs unsheath'd. &nbsp;O power divine!<br>
If thou to me of shine impart so much,<br>
That of that happy realm the shadow'd form<br>
Trac'd in my thoughts I may set forth to view,<br>
Thou shalt behold me of thy favour'd tree<br>
Come to the foot, and crown myself with leaves;<br>
For to that honour thou, and my high theme<br>
Will fit me. &nbsp;If but seldom, mighty Sire!<br>
To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath<br>
Caesar or bard (more shame for human wills<br>
Deprav'd) joy to the Delphic god must spring<br>
From the Pierian foliage, when one breast<br>
Is with such thirst inspir'd. &nbsp;From a small spark<br>
Great flame hath risen: after me perchance<br>
Others with better voice may pray, and gain<br>
From the Cirrhaean city answer kind.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through diver passages, the world's bright lamp<br>
Rises to mortals, but through that which joins<br>
Four circles with the threefold cross, in best<br>
Course, and in happiest constellation set<br>
He comes, and to the worldly wax best gives<br>
Its temper and impression. &nbsp;Morning there,<br>
Here eve was by almost such passage made;<br>
And whiteness had o'erspread that hemisphere,<br>
Blackness the other part; when to the left<br>
I saw Beatrice turn'd, and on the sun<br>
Gazing, as never eagle fix'd his ken.<br>
As from the first a second beam is wont<br>
To issue, and reflected upwards rise,<br>
E'en as a pilgrim bent on his return,<br>
So of her act, that through the eyesight pass'd<br>
Into my fancy, mine was form'd; and straight,<br>
Beyond our mortal wont, I fix'd mine eyes<br>
Upon the sun. &nbsp;Much is allowed us there,<br>
That here exceeds our pow'r; thanks to the place<br>
Made for the dwelling of the human kind<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suffer'd it not long, and yet so long<br>
That I beheld it bick'ring sparks around,<br>
As iron that comes boiling from the fire.<br>
And suddenly upon the day appear'd<br>
A day new-ris'n, as he, who hath the power,<br>
Had with another sun bedeck'd the sky.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes fast fix'd on the eternal wheels,<br>
Beatrice stood unmov'd; and I with ken<br>
Fix'd upon her, from upward gaze remov'd<br>
At her aspect, such inwardly became<br>
As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,<br>
That made him peer among the ocean gods;<br>
Words may not tell of that transhuman change:<br>
And therefore let the example serve, though weak,<br>
For those whom grace hath better proof in store<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were only what thou didst create,<br>
Then newly, Love! by whom the heav'n is rul'd,<br>
Thou know'st, who by thy light didst bear me up.<br>
Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide,<br>
Desired Spirit! with its harmony<br>
Temper'd of thee and measur'd, charm'd mine ear,<br>
Then seem'd to me so much of heav'n to blaze<br>
With the sun's flame, that rain or flood ne'er made<br>
A lake so broad. &nbsp;The newness of the sound,<br>
And that great light, inflam'd me with desire,<br>
Keener than e'er was felt, to know their cause.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence she who saw me, clearly as myself,<br>
To calm my troubled mind, before I ask'd,<br>
Open'd her lips, and gracious thus began:<br>
"With false imagination thou thyself<br>
Mak'st dull, so that thou seest not the thing,<br>
Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off.<br>
Thou art not on the earth as thou believ'st;<br>
For light'ning scap'd from its own proper place<br>
Ne'er ran, as thou hast hither now return'd."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although divested of my first-rais'd doubt,<br>
By those brief words, accompanied with smiles,<br>
Yet in new doubt was I entangled more,<br>
And said: "Already satisfied, I rest<br>
From admiration deep, but now admire<br>
How I above those lighter bodies rise."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence, after utt'rance of a piteous sigh,<br>
She tow'rds me bent her eyes, with such a look,<br>
As on her frenzied child a mother casts;<br>
Then thus began: "Among themselves all things<br>
Have order; and from hence the form, which makes<br>
The universe resemble God. &nbsp;In this<br>
The higher creatures see the printed steps<br>
Of that eternal worth, which is the end<br>
Whither the line is drawn. &nbsp;All natures lean,<br>
In this their order, diversely, some more,<br>
Some less approaching to their primal source.<br>
Thus they to different havens are mov'd on<br>
Through the vast sea of being, and each one<br>
With instinct giv'n, that bears it in its course;<br>
This to the lunar sphere directs the fire,<br>
This prompts the hearts of mortal animals,<br>
This the brute earth together knits, and binds.<br>
Nor only creatures, void of intellect,<br>
Are aim'd at by this bow; but even those,<br>
That have intelligence and love, are pierc'd.<br>
That Providence, who so well orders all,<br>
With her own light makes ever calm the heaven,<br>
In which the substance, that hath greatest speed,<br>
Is turn'd: and thither now, as to our seat<br>
Predestin'd, we are carried by the force<br>
Of that strong cord, that never looses dart,<br>
But at fair aim and glad. &nbsp;Yet is it true,<br>
That as ofttimes but ill accords the form<br>
To the design of art, through sluggishness<br>
Of unreplying matter, so this course<br>
Is sometimes quitted by the creature, who<br>
Hath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere;<br>
As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall,<br>
From its original impulse warp'd, to earth,<br>
By vicious fondness. &nbsp;Thou no more admire<br>
Thy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse<br>
Of torrent downwards from a mountain's height.<br>
There would in thee for wonder be more cause,<br>
If, free of hind'rance, thou hadst fix'd thyself<br>
Below, like fire unmoving on the earth."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So said, she turn'd toward the heav'n her face.</p>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO II</h2>
<br>

<p>All ye, who in small bark have following sail'd,<br>
Eager to listen, on the advent'rous track<br>
Of my proud keel, that singing cuts its way,<br>
Backward return with speed, and your own shores<br>
Revisit, nor put out to open sea,<br>
Where losing me, perchance ye may remain<br>
Bewilder'd in deep maze. &nbsp;The way I pass<br>
Ne'er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale,<br>
Apollo guides me, and another Nine<br>
To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal.<br>
Ye other few, who have outstretch'd the neck.<br>
Timely for food of angels, on which here<br>
They live, yet never know satiety,<br>
Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out<br>
Your vessel, marking, well the furrow broad<br>
Before you in the wave, that on both sides<br>
Equal returns. &nbsp;Those, glorious, who pass'd o'er<br>
To Colchos, wonder'd not as ye will do,<br>
When they saw Jason following the plough.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increate perpetual thirst, that draws<br>
Toward the realm of God's own form, bore us<br>
Swift almost as the heaven ye behold.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beatrice upward gaz'd, and I on her,<br>
And in such space as on the notch a dart<br>
Is plac'd, then loosen'd flies, I saw myself<br>
Arriv'd, where wond'rous thing engag'd my sight.<br>
Whence she, to whom no work of mine was hid,<br>
Turning to me, with aspect glad as fair,<br>
Bespake me: "Gratefully direct thy mind<br>
To God, through whom to this first star we come."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me seem'd as if a cloud had cover'd us,<br>
Translucent, solid, firm, and polish'd bright,<br>
Like adamant, which the sun's beam had smit<br>
Within itself the ever-during pearl<br>
Receiv'd us, as the wave a ray of light<br>
Receives, and rests unbroken. &nbsp;If I then<br>
Was of corporeal frame, and it transcend<br>
Our weaker thought, how one dimension thus<br>
Another could endure, which needs must be<br>
If body enter body, how much more<br>
Must the desire inflame us to behold<br>
That essence, which discovers by what means<br>
God and our nature join'd! &nbsp;There will be seen<br>
That which we hold through faith, not shown by proof,<br>
But in itself intelligibly plain,<br>
E'en as the truth that man at first believes.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I answered: "Lady! I with thoughts devout,<br>
Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him,<br>
Who hath remov'd me from the mortal world.<br>
But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots<br>
Upon this body, which below on earth<br>
Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?"<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She somewhat smil'd, then spake: "If mortals err<br>
In their opinion, when the key of sense<br>
Unlocks not, surely wonder's weapon keen<br>
Ought not to pierce thee; since thou find'st, the wings<br>
Of reason to pursue the senses' flight<br>
Are short. &nbsp;But what thy own thought is, declare."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I: "What various here above appears,<br>
Is caus'd, I deem, by bodies dense or rare."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She then resum'd: "Thou certainly wilt see<br>
In falsehood thy belief o'erwhelm'd, if well<br>
Thou listen to the arguments, which I<br>
Shall bring to face it. &nbsp;The eighth sphere displays<br>
Numberless lights, the which in kind and size<br>
May be remark'd of different aspects;<br>
If rare or dense of that were cause alone,<br>
One single virtue then would be in all,<br>
Alike distributed, or more, or less.<br>
Different virtues needs must be the fruits<br>
Of formal principles, and these, save one,<br>
Will by thy reasoning be destroy'd. &nbsp;Beside,<br>
If rarity were of that dusk the cause,<br>
Which thou inquirest, either in some part<br>
That planet must throughout be void, nor fed<br>
With its own matter; or, as bodies share<br>
Their fat and leanness, in like manner this<br>
Must in its volume change the leaves. &nbsp;The first,<br>
If it were true, had through the sun's eclipse<br>
Been manifested, by transparency<br>
Of light, as through aught rare beside effus'd.<br>
But this is not. &nbsp;Therefore remains to see<br>
The other cause: and if the other fall,<br>
Erroneous so must prove what seem'd to thee.<br>
If not from side to side this rarity<br>
Pass through, there needs must be a limit, whence<br>
Its contrary no further lets it pass.<br>
And hence the beam, that from without proceeds,<br>
Must be pour'd back, as colour comes, through glass<br>
Reflected, which behind it lead conceals.<br>
Now wilt thou say, that there of murkier hue<br>
Than in the other part the ray is shown,<br>
By being thence refracted farther back.<br>
From this perplexity will free thee soon<br>
Experience, if thereof thou trial make,<br>
The fountain whence your arts derive their streame.<br>
Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove<br>
From thee alike, and more remote the third.<br>
Betwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes;<br>
Then turn'd toward them, cause behind thy back<br>
A light to stand, that on the three shall shine,<br>
And thus reflected come to thee from all.<br>
Though that beheld most distant do not stretch<br>
A space so ample, yet in brightness thou<br>
Will own it equaling the rest. &nbsp;But now,<br>
As under snow the ground, if the warm ray<br>
Smites it, remains dismantled of the hue<br>
And cold, that cover'd it before, so thee,<br>
Dismantled in thy mind, I will inform<br>
With light so lively, that the tremulous beam<br>
Shall quiver where it falls. &nbsp;Within the heaven,<br>
Where peace divine inhabits, circles round<br>
A body, in whose virtue dies the being<br>
Of all that it contains. &nbsp;The following heaven,<br>
That hath so many lights, this being divides,<br>
Through &nbsp;different essences, from it distinct,<br>
And yet contain'd within it. &nbsp;The other orbs<br>
Their separate distinctions variously<br>
Dispose, for their own seed and produce apt.<br>
Thus do these organs of the world proceed,<br>
As thou beholdest now, from step to step,<br>
Their influences from above deriving,<br>
And thence transmitting downwards. &nbsp;Mark me well,<br>
How through this passage to the truth I ford,<br>
The truth thou lov'st, that thou henceforth alone,<br>
May'st know to keep the shallows, safe, untold.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs,<br>
As mallet by the workman's hand, must needs<br>
By blessed movers be inspir'd. &nbsp;This heaven,<br>
Made beauteous by so many luminaries,<br>
From the deep spirit, that moves its circling sphere,<br>
Its image takes an impress as a seal:<br>
And as the soul, that dwells within your dust,<br>
Through members different, yet together form'd,<br>
In different pow'rs resolves itself; e'en so<br>
The intellectual efficacy unfolds<br>
Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars;<br>
On its own unity revolving still.<br>
Different virtue compact different<br>
Makes with the precious body it enlivens,<br>
With which it knits, as life in you is knit.<br>
From its original nature full of joy,<br>
The virtue mingled through the body shines,<br>
As joy through pupil of the living eye.<br>
From hence proceeds, that which from light to light<br>
Seems different, and not from dense or rare.<br>
This is the formal cause, that generates<br>
Proportion'd to its power, the dusk or clear."</p>

<h2>CANTO III</h2>
<br>

<p>That sun, which erst with love my bosom warm'd<br>
Had of fair truth unveil'd the sweet aspect,<br>
By proof of right, and of the false reproof;<br>
And I, to own myself convinc'd and free<br>
Of doubt, as much as needed, rais'd my head<br>
Erect for speech. &nbsp;But soon a sight appear'd,<br>
Which, so intent to mark it, held me fix'd,<br>
That of confession I no longer thought.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/03-14.jpg"><img alt="03-14th.jpg (32K)" src="images/03-14th.jpg" height="469" width="433"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As through translucent and smooth glass, or wave<br>
Clear and unmov'd, and flowing not so deep<br>
As that its bed is dark, the shape returns<br>
So faint of our impictur'd lineaments,<br>
That on white forehead set a pearl as strong<br>
Comes to the eye: such saw I many a face,<br>
All stretch'd to speak, from whence I straight conceiv'd<br>
Delusion opposite to that, which rais'd<br>
Between the man and fountain, amorous flame.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden, as I perceiv'd them, deeming these<br>
Reflected semblances to see of whom<br>
They were, I turn'd mine eyes, and nothing saw;<br>
Then turn'd them back, directed on the light<br>
Of my sweet guide, who smiling shot forth beams<br>
From her celestial eyes. &nbsp;"Wonder not thou,"<br>
She cry'd, "at this my smiling, when I see<br>
Thy childish judgment; since not yet on truth<br>
It rests the foot, but, as it still is wont,<br>
Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy.<br>
True substances are these, which thou behold'st,<br>
Hither through failure of their vow exil'd.<br>
But speak thou with them; listen, and believe,<br>
That the true light, which fills them with desire,<br>
Permits not from its beams their feet to stray."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight to the shadow which for converse seem'd<br>
Most earnest, I addressed me, and began,<br>
As one by over-eagerness perplex'd:<br>
"O spirit, born for joy! who in the rays<br>
Of life eternal, of that sweetness know'st<br>
The flavour, which, not tasted, passes far<br>
All apprehension, me it well would please,<br>
If thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this<br>
Your station here." Whence she, with kindness prompt,<br>
And eyes glist'ning with smiles: "Our charity,<br>
To any wish by justice introduc'd,<br>
Bars not the door, no more than she above,<br>
Who would have all her court be like herself.<br>
I was a virgin sister in the earth;<br>
And if thy mind observe me well, this form,<br>
With such addition grac'd of loveliness,<br>
Will not conceal me long, but thou wilt know<br>
Piccarda, in the tardiest sphere thus plac'd,<br>
Here 'mid these other blessed also blest.<br>
Our hearts, whose high affections burn alone<br>
With pleasure, from the Holy Spirit conceiv'd,<br>
Admitted to his order dwell in joy.<br>
And this condition, which appears so low,<br>
Is for this cause assign'd us, that our vows<br>
Were in some part neglected and made void."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence I to her replied: "Something divine<br>
Beams in your countenance, wond'rous fair,<br>
From former knowledge quite transmuting you.<br>
Therefore to recollect was I so slow.<br>
But what thou sayst hath to my memory<br>
Given now such aid, that to retrace your forms<br>
Is easier. &nbsp;Yet inform me, ye, who here<br>
Are happy, long ye for a higher place<br>
More to behold, and more in love to dwell?"<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She with those other spirits gently smil'd,<br>
Then answer'd with such gladness, that she seem'd<br>
With love's first flame to glow: "Brother! our will<br>
Is in composure settled by the power<br>
Of charity, who makes us will alone<br>
What we possess, and nought beyond desire;<br>
If we should wish to be exalted more,<br>
Then must our wishes jar with the high will<br>
Of him, who sets us here, which in these orbs<br>
Thou wilt confess not possible, if here<br>
To be in charity must needs befall,<br>
And if her nature well thou contemplate.<br>
Rather it is inherent in this state<br>
Of blessedness, to keep ourselves within<br>
The divine will, by which our wills with his<br>
Are one. &nbsp;So that as we from step to step<br>
Are plac'd throughout this kingdom, pleases all,<br>
E'en as our King, who in us plants his will;<br>
And in his will is our tranquillity;<br>
It is the mighty ocean, whither tends<br>
Whatever it creates and nature makes."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then saw I clearly how each spot in heav'n<br>
Is Paradise, though with like gracious dew<br>
The supreme virtue show'r not over all.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as it chances, if one sort of food<br>
Hath satiated, and of another still<br>
The appetite remains, that this is ask'd,<br>
And thanks for that return'd; e'en so did I<br>
In word and motion, bent from her to learn<br>
What web it was, through which she had not drawn<br>
The shuttle to its point. &nbsp;She thus began:<br>
"Exalted worth and perfectness of life<br>
The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven,<br>
By whose pure laws upon your nether earth<br>
The robe and veil they wear, to that intent,<br>
That e'en till death they may keep watch or sleep<br>
With their great bridegroom, who accepts each vow,<br>
Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms.<br>
from the world, to follow her, when young<br>
Escap'd; and, in her vesture mantling me,<br>
Made promise of the way her sect enjoins.<br>
Thereafter men, for ill than good more apt,<br>
Forth snatch'd me from the pleasant cloister's pale.<br>
God knows how after that my life was fram'd.<br>
This other splendid shape, which thou beholdst<br>
At my right side, burning with all the light<br>
Of this our orb, what of myself I tell<br>
May to herself apply. &nbsp;From her, like me<br>
A sister, with like violence were torn<br>
The saintly folds, that shaded her fair brows.<br>
E'en when she to the world again was brought<br>
In spite of her own will and better wont,<br>
Yet not for that the bosom's inward veil<br>
Did she renounce. &nbsp;This is the luminary<br>
Of mighty Constance, who from that loud blast,<br>
Which blew the second over Suabia's realm,<br>
That power produc'd, which was the third and last."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ceas'd from further talk, and then began<br>
"Ave Maria" singing, and with that song<br>
Vanish'd, as heavy substance through deep wave.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine eye, that far as it was capable,<br>
Pursued her, when in dimness she was lost,<br>
Turn'd to the mark where greater want impell'd,<br>
And bent on Beatrice all its gaze.<br>
But she as light'ning beam'd upon my looks:<br>
So that the sight sustain'd it not at first.<br>
Whence I to question her became less prompt.</p>

<h2>CANTO IV</h2>
<br>

<p>Between two kinds of food, both equally<br>
Remote and tempting, first a man might die<br>
Of hunger, ere he one could freely choose.<br>
E'en so would stand a lamb between the maw<br>
Of two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike:<br>
E'en so between two deer a dog would stand,<br>
Wherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise<br>
I to myself impute, by equal doubts<br>
Held in suspense, since of necessity<br>
It happen'd. &nbsp;Silent was I, yet desire<br>
Was painted in my looks; and thus I spake<br>
My wish more earnestly than language could.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Daniel, when the haughty king he freed<br>
From ire, that spurr'd him on to deeds unjust<br>
And violent; so look'd Beatrice then.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well I discern," she thus her words address'd,<br>
"How contrary desires each way constrain thee,<br>
So that thy anxious thought is in itself<br>
Bound up and stifled, nor breathes freely forth.<br>
Thou arguest; if the good intent remain;<br>
What reason that another's violence<br>
Should stint the measure of my fair desert?<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cause too thou findst for doubt, in that it seems,<br>
That spirits to the stars, as Plato deem'd,<br>
Return. &nbsp;These are the questions which thy will<br>
Urge equally; and therefore I the first<br>
Of that will treat which hath the more of gall.<br>
Of seraphim he who is most ensky'd,<br>
Moses and Samuel, and either John,<br>
Choose which thou wilt, nor even Mary's self,<br>
Have not in any other heav'n their seats,<br>
Than have those spirits which so late thou saw'st;<br>
Nor more or fewer years exist; but all<br>
Make the first circle beauteous, diversely<br>
Partaking of sweet life, as more or less<br>
Afflation of eternal bliss pervades them.<br>
Here were they shown thee, not that fate assigns<br>
This for their sphere, but for a sign to thee<br>
Of that celestial furthest from the height.<br>
Thus needs, that ye may apprehend, we speak:<br>
Since from things sensible alone ye learn<br>
That, which digested rightly after turns<br>
To intellectual. &nbsp;For no other cause<br>
The scripture, condescending graciously<br>
To your perception, hands and feet to God<br>
Attributes, nor so means: and holy church<br>
Doth represent with human countenance<br>
Gabriel, and Michael, and him who made<br>
Tobias whole. &nbsp;Unlike what here thou seest,<br>
The judgment of Timaeus, who affirms<br>
Each soul restor'd to its particular star,<br>
Believing it to have been taken thence,<br>
When nature gave it to inform her mold:<br>
Since to appearance his intention is<br>
E'en what his words declare: or else to shun<br>
Derision, haply thus he hath disguis'd<br>
His true opinion. &nbsp;If his meaning be,<br>
That to the influencing of these orbs revert<br>
The honour and the blame in human acts,<br>
Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth.<br>
This principle, not understood aright,<br>
Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world;<br>
So that it fell to fabled names of Jove,<br>
And Mercury, and Mars. &nbsp;That other doubt,<br>
Which moves thee, is less harmful; for it brings<br>
No peril of removing thee from me.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, to the eye of man, our justice seems<br>
Unjust, is argument for faith, and not<br>
For heretic declension. &nbsp;To the end<br>
This truth may stand more clearly in your view,<br>
I will content thee even to thy wish<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If violence be, when that which suffers, nought<br>
Consents to that which forceth, not for this<br>
These spirits stood exculpate. &nbsp;For the will,<br>
That will not, still survives unquench'd, and doth<br>
As nature doth in fire, tho' violence<br>
Wrest it a thousand times; for, if it yield<br>
Or more or less, so far it follows force.<br>
And thus did these, whom they had power to seek<br>
The hallow'd place again. &nbsp;In them, had will<br>
Been perfect, such as once upon the bars<br>
Held Laurence firm, or wrought in Scaevola<br>
To his own hand remorseless, to the path,<br>
Whence they were drawn, their steps had hasten'd back,<br>
When liberty return'd: but in too few<br>
Resolve so steadfast dwells. &nbsp;And by these words<br>
If duly weigh'd, that argument is void,<br>
Which oft might have perplex'd thee still. &nbsp;But now<br>
Another question thwarts thee, which to solve<br>
Might try thy patience without better aid.<br>
I have, no doubt, instill'd into thy mind,<br>
That blessed spirit may not lie; since near<br>
The source of primal truth it dwells for aye:<br>
And thou might'st after of Piccarda learn<br>
That Constance held affection to the veil;<br>
So that she seems to contradict me here.<br>
Not seldom, brother, it hath chanc'd for men<br>
To do what they had gladly left undone,<br>
Yet to shun peril they have done amiss:<br>
E'en as Alcmaeon, at his father's suit<br>
Slew his own mother, so made pitiless<br>
Not to lose pity. &nbsp;On this point bethink thee,<br>
That force and will are blended in such wise<br>
As not to make the' offence excusable.<br>
Absolute will agrees not to the wrong,<br>
That inasmuch as there is fear of woe<br>
From non-compliance, it agrees. &nbsp;Of will<br>
Thus absolute Piccarda spake, and I<br>
Of th' other; so that both have truly said."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the flow of that pure rill, that well'd<br>
From forth the fountain of all truth; and such<br>
The rest, that to my wond'ring thoughts I found.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O thou of primal love the prime delight!<br>
Goddess!" &nbsp;I straight reply'd, "whose lively words<br>
Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul!<br>
Affection fails me to requite thy grace<br>
With equal sum of gratitude: be his<br>
To recompense, who sees and can reward thee.<br>
Well I discern, that by that truth alone<br>
Enlighten'd, beyond which no truth may roam,<br>
Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know:<br>
Therein she resteth, e'en as in his lair<br>
The wild beast, soon as she hath reach'd that bound,<br>
And she hath power to reach it; else desire<br>
Were given to no end. &nbsp;And thence doth doubt<br>
Spring, like a shoot, around the stock of truth;<br>
And it is nature which from height to height<br>
On to the summit prompts us. &nbsp;This invites,<br>
This doth assure me, lady, rev'rently<br>
To ask thee of other truth, that yet<br>
Is dark to me. &nbsp;I fain would know, if man<br>
By other works well done may so supply<br>
The failure of his vows, that in your scale<br>
They lack not weight." &nbsp;I spake; and on me straight<br>
Beatrice look'd with eyes that shot forth sparks<br>
Of love celestial in such copious stream,<br>
That, virtue sinking in me overpower'd,<br>
I turn'd, and downward bent confus'd my sight.</p>

<h2>CANTO V</h2>
<br>

<p>"If beyond earthly wont, the flame of love<br>
Illume me, so that I o'ercome thy power<br>
Of vision, marvel not: but learn the cause<br>
In that perfection of the sight, which soon<br>
As apprehending, hasteneth on to reach<br>
The good it apprehends. &nbsp;I well discern,<br>
How in thine intellect already shines<br>
The light eternal, which to view alone<br>
Ne'er fails to kindle love; and if aught else<br>
Your love seduces, 't is but that it shows<br>
Some ill-mark'd vestige of that primal beam.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This would'st thou know, if failure of the vow<br>
By other service may be so supplied,<br>
As from self-question to assure the soul."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus she her words, not heedless of my wish,<br>
Began; and thus, as one who breaks not off<br>
Discourse, continued in her saintly strain.<br>
"Supreme of gifts, which God creating gave<br>
Of his free bounty, sign most evident<br>
Of goodness, and in his account most priz'd,<br>
Was liberty of will, the boon wherewith<br>
All intellectual creatures, and them sole<br>
He hath endow'd. &nbsp;Hence now thou mayst infer<br>
Of what high worth the vow, which so is fram'd<br>
That when man offers, God well-pleas'd accepts;<br>
For in the compact between God and him,<br>
This treasure, such as I describe it to thee,<br>
He makes the victim, and of his own act.<br>
What compensation therefore may he find?<br>
If that, whereof thou hast oblation made,<br>
By using well thou think'st to consecrate,<br>
Thou would'st of theft do charitable deed.<br>
Thus I resolve thee of the greater point.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But forasmuch as holy church, herein<br>
Dispensing, seems to contradict the truth<br>
I have discover'd to thee, yet behooves<br>
Thou rest a little longer at the board,<br>
Ere the crude aliment, which thou hast taken,<br>
Digested fitly to nutrition turn.<br>
Open thy mind to what I now unfold,<br>
And give it inward keeping. &nbsp;Knowledge comes<br>
Of learning well retain'd, unfruitful else.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This sacrifice in essence of two things<br>
Consisteth; one is that, whereof 't is made,<br>
The covenant the other. &nbsp;For the last,<br>
It ne'er is cancell'd if not kept: and hence<br>
I spake erewhile so strictly of its force.<br>
For this it was enjoin'd the Israelites,<br>
Though leave were giv'n them, as thou know'st, to change<br>
The offering, still to offer. &nbsp;Th' other part,<br>
The matter and the substance of the vow,<br>
May well be such, to that without offence<br>
It may for other substance be exchang'd.<br>
But at his own discretion none may shift<br>
The burden on his shoulders, unreleas'd<br>
By either key, the yellow and the white.<br>
Nor deem of any change, as less than vain,<br>
If the last bond be not within the new<br>
Included, as the quatre in the six.<br>
No satisfaction therefore can be paid<br>
For what so precious in the balance weighs,<br>
That all in counterpoise must kick the beam.<br>
Take then no vow at random: ta'en, with faith<br>
Preserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,<br>
Blindly to execute a rash resolve,<br>
Whom better it had suited to exclaim,<br>
'I have done ill,' than to redeem his pledge<br>
By doing worse or, not unlike to him<br>
In folly, that great leader of the Greeks:<br>
Whence, on the alter, Iphigenia mourn'd<br>
Her virgin beauty, and hath since made mourn<br>
Both wise and simple, even all, who hear<br>
Of so fell sacrifice. &nbsp;Be ye more staid,<br>
O Christians, not, like feather, by each wind<br>
Removable: nor think to cleanse ourselves<br>
In every water. &nbsp;Either testament,<br>
The old and new, is yours: and for your guide<br>
The shepherd of the church let this suffice<br>
To save you. &nbsp;When by evil lust entic'd,<br>
Remember ye be men, not senseless beasts;<br>
Nor let the Jew, who dwelleth in your streets,<br>
Hold you in mock'ry. &nbsp;Be not, as the lamb,<br>
That, fickle wanton, leaves its mother's milk,<br>
To dally with itself in idle play."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such were the words that Beatrice spake:<br>
These ended, to that region, where the world<br>
Is liveliest, full of fond desire she turn'd.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though mainly prompt new question to propose,<br>
Her silence and chang'd look did keep me dumb.<br>
And as the arrow, ere the cord is still,<br>
Leapeth unto its mark; so on we sped<br>
Into the second realm. &nbsp;There I beheld<br>
The dame, so joyous enter, that the orb<br>
Grew brighter at her smiles; and, if the star<br>
Were mov'd to gladness, what then was my cheer,<br>
Whom nature hath made apt for every change!<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in a quiet and clear lake the fish,<br>
If aught approach them from without, do draw<br>
Towards it, deeming it their food; so drew<br>
Full more than thousand splendours towards us,<br>
And in each one was heard: "Lo! one arriv'd<br>
To multiply our loves!" and as each came<br>
The shadow, streaming forth effulgence new,<br>
Witness'd augmented joy. &nbsp;Here, reader! think,<br>
If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale,<br>
To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave;<br>
And thou shalt see what vehement desire<br>
Possess'd me, as soon as these had met my view,<br>
To know their state. &nbsp;"O born in happy hour!<br>
Thou to whom grace vouchsafes, or ere thy close<br>
Of fleshly warfare, to behold the thrones<br>
Of that eternal triumph, know to us<br>
The light communicated, which through heaven<br>
Expatiates without bound. &nbsp;Therefore, if aught<br>
Thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid,<br>
Spare not; and of our radiance take thy fill."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus of those piteous spirits one bespake me;<br>
And Beatrice next: "Say on; and trust<br>
As unto gods!"&mdash;"How in the light supreme<br>
Thou harbour'st, and from thence the virtue bring'st,<br>
That, sparkling in thine eyes, denotes thy joy,<br>
l mark; but, who thou art, am still to seek;<br>
Or wherefore, worthy spirit! for thy lot<br>
This sphere assign'd, that oft from mortal ken<br>
Is veil'd by others' beams." &nbsp;I said, and turn'd<br>
Toward the lustre, that with greeting, kind<br>
Erewhile had hail'd me. &nbsp;Forthwith brighter far<br>
Than erst, it wax'd: and, as himself the sun<br>
Hides through excess of light, when his warm gaze<br>
Hath on the mantle of thick vapours prey'd;<br>
Within its proper ray the saintly shape<br>
Was, through increase of gladness, thus conceal'd;<br>
And, shrouded so in splendour answer'd me,<br>
E'en as the tenour of my song declares.</p>

<p>"After that Constantine the eagle turn'd<br>
Against the motions of the heav'n, that roll'd<br>
Consenting with its course, when he of yore,<br>
Lavinia's spouse, was leader of the flight,<br>
A hundred years twice told and more, his seat<br>
At Europe's extreme point, the bird of Jove<br>
Held, near the mountains, whence he issued first.<br>
There, under shadow of his sacred plumes<br>
Swaying the world, till through successive hands<br>
To mine he came devolv'd. &nbsp;Caesar I was,<br>
And am Justinian; destin'd by the will<br>
Of that prime love, whose influence I feel,<br>
From vain excess to clear th' encumber'd laws.<br>
Or ere that work engag'd me, I did hold<br>
Christ's nature merely human, with such faith<br>
Contented. &nbsp;But the blessed Agapete,<br>
Who was chief shepherd, he with warning voice<br>
To the true faith recall'd me. &nbsp;I believ'd<br>
His words: and what he taught, now plainly see,<br>
As thou in every contradiction seest<br>
The true and false oppos'd. &nbsp;Soon as my feet<br>
Were to the church reclaim'd, to my great task,<br>
By inspiration of God's grace impell'd,<br>
I gave me wholly, and consign'd mine arms<br>
To Belisarius, with whom heaven's right hand<br>
Was link'd in such conjointment, 't was a sign<br>
That I should rest. &nbsp;To thy first question thus<br>
I shape mine answer, which were ended here,<br>
But that its tendency doth prompt perforce<br>
To some addition; that thou well, mayst mark<br>
What reason on each side they have to plead,<br>
By whom that holiest banner is withstood,<br>
Both who pretend its power and who oppose.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beginning from that hour, when Pallas died<br>
To give it rule, behold the valorous deeds<br>
Have made it worthy reverence. &nbsp;Not unknown<br>
To thee, how for three hundred years and more<br>
It dwelt in Alba, up to those fell lists<br>
Where for its sake were met the rival three;<br>
Nor aught unknown to thee, which it achiev'd<br>
Down to the Sabines' wrong to Lucrece' woe,<br>
With its sev'n kings conqu'ring the nation round;<br>
Nor all it wrought, by Roman worthies home<br>
'Gainst Brennus and th' Epirot prince, and hosts<br>
Of single chiefs, or states in league combin'd<br>
Of social warfare; hence Torquatus stern,<br>
And Quintius nam'd of his neglected locks,<br>
The Decii, and the Fabii hence acquir'd<br>
Their fame, which I with duteous zeal embalm.<br>
By it the pride of Arab hordes was quell'd,<br>
When they led on by Hannibal o'erpass'd<br>
The Alpine rocks, whence glide thy currents, Po!<br>
Beneath its guidance, in their prime of days<br>
Scipio and Pompey triumph'd; and that hill,<br>
Under whose summit thou didst see the light,<br>
Rued its stern bearing. &nbsp;After, near the hour,<br>
When heav'n was minded that o'er all the world<br>
His own deep calm should brood, to Caesar's hand<br>
Did Rome consign it; and what then it wrought<br>
From Var unto the Rhine, saw Isere's flood,<br>
Saw Loire and Seine, and every vale, that fills<br>
The torrent Rhone. &nbsp;What after that it wrought,<br>
When from Ravenna it came forth, and leap'd<br>
The Rubicon, was of so bold a flight,<br>
That tongue nor pen may follow it. &nbsp;Tow'rds Spain<br>
It wheel'd its bands, then tow'rd Dyrrachium smote,<br>
And on Pharsalia with so fierce a plunge,<br>
E'en the warm Nile was conscious to the pang;<br>
Its native shores Antandros, and the streams<br>
Of Simois revisited, and there<br>
Where Hector lies; then ill for Ptolemy<br>
His pennons shook again; lightning thence fell<br>
On Juba; and the next upon your west,<br>
At sound of the Pompeian trump, return'd.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What following and in its next bearer's gripe<br>
It wrought, is now by Cassius and Brutus<br>
Bark'd off in hell, and by Perugia's sons<br>
And Modena's was mourn'd. &nbsp;Hence weepeth still<br>
Sad Cleopatra, who, pursued by it,<br>
Took from the adder black and sudden death.<br>
With him it ran e'en to the Red Sea coast;<br>
With him compos'd the world to such a peace,<br>
That of his temple Janus barr'd the door.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But all the mighty standard yet had wrought,<br>
And was appointed to perform thereafter,<br>

On the third Caesar look; for to his hands,<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hear now and wonder at what next I tell.<br>
After with Titus it was sent to wreak<br>
Vengeance for vengeance of the ancient sin,<br>
And, when the Lombard tooth, with fangs impure,<br>
Did gore the bosom of the holy church,<br>
Under its wings victorious, Charlemagne<br>
Sped to her rescue. &nbsp;Judge then for thyself<br>
Of those, whom I erewhile accus'd to thee,<br>
What they are, and how grievous their offending,<br>
Who are the cause of all your ills. &nbsp;The one<br>
Against the universal ensign rears<br>
The yellow lilies, and with partial aim<br>
That to himself the other arrogates:<br>
So that 't is hard to see which more offends.<br>
Be yours, ye Ghibellines, to veil your arts<br>
Beneath another standard: ill is this<br>
Follow'd of him, who severs it and justice:<br>
And let not with his Guelphs the new-crown'd Charles<br>
Assail it, but those talons hold in dread,<br>
Which from a lion of more lofty port<br>
Have rent the easing. &nbsp;Many a time ere now<br>
The sons have for the sire's transgression wail'd;<br>
Nor let him trust the fond belief, that heav'n<br>
Will truck its armour for his lilied shield.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This little star is furnish'd with good spirits,<br>
Whose mortal lives were busied to that end,<br>
That honour and renown might wait on them:<br>
And, when desires thus err in their intention,<br>
True love must needs ascend with slacker beam.<br>
But it is part of our delight, to measure<br>
Our wages with the merit; and admire<br>
The close proportion. &nbsp;Hence doth heav'nly justice<br>
Temper so evenly affection in us,<br>
It ne'er can warp to any wrongfulness.<br>
Of diverse voices is sweet music made:<br>
So in our life the different degrees<br>
Render sweet harmony among these wheels.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Within the pearl, that now encloseth us,<br>
Shines Romeo's light, whose goodly deed and fair<br>
Met ill acceptance. &nbsp;But the Provencals,<br>
That were his foes, have little cause for mirth.<br>
Ill shapes that man his course, who makes his wrong<br>
Of other's worth. &nbsp;Four daughters were there born<br>
To Raymond Berenger, and every one<br>
Became a queen; and this for him did Romeo,<br>
Though of mean state and from a foreign land.<br>
Yet envious tongues incited him to ask<br>
A reckoning of that just one, who return'd<br>
Twelve fold to him for ten. &nbsp;Aged and poor<br>
He parted thence: and if the world did know<br>
The heart he had, begging his life by morsels,<br>
'T would deem the praise, it yields him, scantly dealt."</p>

<h2>CANTO VII</h2>
<br>

<p>"Hosanna Sanctus Deus Sabaoth<br>
Superillustrans claritate tua<br>
Felices ignes horum malahoth!"<br>
Thus chanting saw I turn that substance bright<br>
With fourfold lustre to its orb again,<br>
Revolving; and the rest unto their dance<br>
With it mov'd also; and like swiftest sparks,<br>
In sudden distance from my sight were veil'd.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me doubt possess'd, and "Speak," it whisper'd me,<br>
"Speak, speak unto thy lady, that she quench<br>
Thy thirst with drops of sweetness." &nbsp;Yet blank awe,<br>
Which lords it o'er me, even at the sound<br>
Of Beatrice's name, did bow me down<br>
As one in slumber held. &nbsp;Not long that mood<br>
Beatrice suffer'd: she, with such a smile,<br>
As might have made one blest amid the flames,<br>
Beaming upon me, thus her words began:<br>
"Thou in thy thought art pond'ring (as I deem),<br>
And what I deem is truth how just revenge<br>
Could be with justice punish'd: from which doubt<br>
I soon will free thee; so thou mark my words;<br>
For they of weighty matter shall possess thee.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That man, who was unborn, himself condemn'd,<br>
And, in himself, all, who since him have liv'd,<br>
His offspring: whence, below, the human kind<br>
Lay sick in grievous error many an age;<br>
Until it pleas'd the Word of God to come<br>
Amongst them down, to his own person joining<br>
The nature, from its Maker far estrang'd,<br>
By the mere act of his eternal love.<br>
Contemplate here the wonder I unfold.<br>
The nature with its Maker thus conjoin'd,<br>
Created first was blameless, pure and good;<br>
But through itself alone was driven forth<br>
From Paradise, because it had eschew'd<br>
The way of truth and life, to evil turn'd.<br>
Ne'er then was penalty so just as that<br>
Inflicted by the cross, if thou regard<br>
The nature in assumption doom'd: ne'er wrong<br>
So great, in reference to him, who took<br>
Such nature on him, and endur'd the doom.<br>
God therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased:<br>
So different effects flow'd from one act,<br>
And heav'n was open'd, though the earth did quake.<br>
Count it not hard henceforth, when thou dost hear<br>
That a just vengeance was by righteous court<br>
Justly reveng'd. &nbsp;But yet I see thy mind<br>
By thought on thought arising sore perplex'd,<br>
And with how vehement desire it asks<br>
Solution of the maze. &nbsp;What I have heard,<br>
Is plain, thou sayst: but wherefore God this way<br>
For our redemption chose, eludes my search.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother! no eye of man not perfected,<br>
Nor fully ripen'd in the flame of love,<br>
May fathom this decree. &nbsp;It is a mark,<br>
In sooth, much aim'd at, and but little kenn'd:<br>
And I will therefore show thee why such way<br>
Was worthiest. &nbsp;The celestial love, that spume<br>
All envying in its bounty, in itself<br>
With such effulgence blazeth, as sends forth<br>
All beauteous things eternal. &nbsp;What distils<br>
Immediate thence, no end of being knows,<br>
Bearing its seal immutably impress'd.<br>
Whatever thence immediate falls, is free,<br>
Free wholly, uncontrollable by power<br>
Of each thing new: by such conformity<br>
More grateful to its author, whose bright beams,<br>
Though all partake their shining, yet in those<br>
Are liveliest, which resemble him the most.<br>
These tokens of pre-eminence on man<br>
Largely bestow'd, if any of them fail,<br>
He needs must forfeit his nobility,<br>
No longer stainless. &nbsp;Sin alone is that,<br>
Which doth disfranchise him, and make unlike<br>
To the chief good; for that its light in him<br>
Is darken'd. &nbsp;And to dignity thus lost<br>
Is no return; unless, where guilt makes void,<br>
He for ill pleasure pay with equal pain.<br>
Your nature, which entirely in its seed<br>
Trangress'd, from these distinctions fell, no less<br>
Than from its state in Paradise; nor means<br>
Found of recovery (search all methods out<br>
As strickly as thou may) save one of these,<br>
The only fords were left through which to wade,<br>
Either that God had of his courtesy<br>
Releas'd him merely, or else man himself<br>
For his own folly by himself aton'd.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fix now thine eye, intently as thou canst,<br>
On th' everlasting counsel, and explore,<br>
Instructed by my words, the dread abyss.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man in himself had ever lack'd the means<br>
Of satisfaction, for he could not stoop<br>
Obeying, in humility so low,<br>
As high he, disobeying, thought to soar:<br>
And for this reason he had vainly tried<br>
Out of his own sufficiency to pay<br>
The rigid satisfaction. &nbsp;Then behooved<br>
That God should by his own ways lead him back<br>
Unto the life, from whence he fell, restor'd:<br>
By both his ways, I mean, or one alone.<br>
But since the deed is ever priz'd the more,<br>
The more the doer's good intent appears,<br>
Goodness celestial, whose broad signature<br>
Is on the universe, of all its ways<br>
To raise ye up, was fain to leave out none,<br>
Nor aught so vast or so magnificent,<br>
Either for him who gave or who receiv'd<br>
Between the last night and the primal day,<br>
Was or can be. &nbsp;For God more bounty show'd.<br>
Giving himself to make man capable<br>
Of his return to life, than had the terms<br>
Been mere and unconditional release.<br>
And for his justice, every method else<br>
Were all too scant, had not the Son of God<br>
Humbled himself to put on mortal flesh.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, to fulfil each wish of thine, remains<br>
I somewhat further to thy view unfold.<br>
That thou mayst see as clearly as myself.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see, thou sayst, the air, the fire I see,<br>
The earth and water, and all things of them<br>
Compounded, to corruption turn, and soon<br>
Dissolve. &nbsp;Yet these were also things create,<br>
Because, if what were told me, had been true<br>
They from corruption had been therefore free.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The angels, O my brother! and this clime<br>
Wherein thou art, impassible and pure,<br>
I call created, as indeed they are<br>
In their whole being. &nbsp;But the elements,<br>
Which thou hast nam'd, and what of them is made,<br>
Are by created virtue' inform'd: create<br>
Their substance, and create the' informing virtue<br>
In these bright stars, that round them circling move<br>
The soul of every brute and of each plant,<br>
The ray and motion of the sacred lights,<br>
With complex potency attract and turn.<br>
But this our life the' eternal good inspires<br>
Immediate, and enamours of itself;<br>
So that our wishes rest for ever here.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And hence thou mayst by inference conclude<br>
Our resurrection certain, if thy mind<br>
Consider how the human flesh was fram'd,<br>
When both our parents at the first were made."</p>

<h2>CANTO VIII</h2>
<br>

<p>The world was in its day of peril dark<br>
Wont to believe the dotage of fond love<br>
From the fair Cyprian deity, who rolls<br>
In her third epicycle, shed on men<br>
By stream of potent radiance: therefore they<br>
Of elder time, in their old error blind,<br>
Not her alone with sacrifice ador'd<br>
And invocation, but like honours paid<br>
To Cupid and Dione, deem'd of them<br>
Her mother, and her son, him whom they feign'd<br>
To sit in Dido's bosom: and from her,<br>
Whom I have sung preluding, borrow'd they<br>
The appellation of that star, which views,<br>
Now obvious and now averse, the sun.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not ware that I was wafted up<br>
Into &nbsp;its orb; but the new loveliness<br>
That grac'd my lady, gave me ample proof<br>
That we had entered there. &nbsp;And as in flame<br>
A sparkle is distinct, or voice in voice<br>
Discern'd, when one its even tenour keeps,<br>
The other comes and goes; so in that light<br>
I other luminaries saw, that cours'd<br>
In circling motion rapid more or less,<br>
As their eternal phases each impels.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never was blast from vapour charged with cold,<br>
Whether invisible to eye or no,<br>
Descended with such speed, it had not seem'd<br>
To linger in dull tardiness, compar'd<br>
To those celestial lights, that tow'rds us came,<br>
Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring,<br>
Conducted by the lofty seraphim.<br>
And after them, who in the van appear'd,<br>
Such an hosanna sounded, as hath left<br>
Desire, ne'er since extinct in me, to hear<br>
Renew'd the strain. &nbsp;Then parting from the rest<br>
One near us drew, and sole began: "We all<br>
Are ready at thy pleasure, well dispos'd<br>
To do thee gentle service. &nbsp;We are they,<br>
To whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing<br>
'O ye! whose intellectual ministry<br>
Moves the third heaven!' and in one orb we roll,<br>
One motion, one impulse, with those who rule<br>
Princedoms in heaven; yet are of love so full,<br>
That to please thee 't will be as sweet to rest."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mine eyes had with meek reverence<br>
Sought the celestial guide, and were by her<br>
Assur'd, they turn'd again unto the light<br>
Who had so largely promis'd, and with voice<br>
That bare the lively pressure of my zeal,<br>
"Tell who ye are," I cried. &nbsp;Forthwith it grew<br>
In size and splendour, through augmented joy;<br>
And thus it answer'd: "A short date below<br>
The world possess'd me. &nbsp;Had the time been more,<br>
Much evil, that will come, had never chanc'd.<br>
My gladness hides thee from me, which doth shine<br>
Around, and shroud me, as an animal<br>
In its own silk unswath'd. &nbsp;Thou lov'dst me well,<br>
And had'st good cause; for had my sojourning<br>
Been longer on the earth, the love I bare thee<br>
Had put forth more than blossoms. &nbsp;The left bank,<br>
That Rhone, when he hath mix'd with Sorga, laves."<br>

"In me its lord expected, and that horn<br>
Of fair Ausonia, with its boroughs old,<br>
Bari, and Croton, and Gaeta pil'd,<br>
From where the Trento disembogues his waves,<br>
With Verde mingled, to the salt sea-flood.<br>
Already on my temples beam'd the crown,<br>
Which gave me sov'reignty over the land<br>
By Danube wash'd, whenas he strays beyond<br>
The limits of his German shores. &nbsp;The realm,<br>
Where, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash'd,<br>
Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights,<br>
The beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom<br>
(Not through Typhaeus, but the vap'ry cloud<br>
Bituminous upsteam'd), THAT too did look<br>
To have its scepter wielded by a race<br>
Of monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph;<br>
had not ill lording which doth spirit up<br>
The people ever, in Palermo rais'd<br>
The shout of 'death,' re-echo'd loud and long.<br>
Had but my brother's foresight kenn'd as much,<br>
He had been warier that the greedy want<br>
Of Catalonia might not work his bale.<br>
And truly need there is, that he forecast,<br>
Or other for him, lest more freight be laid<br>
On his already over-laden bark.<br>
Nature in him, from bounty fall'n to thrift,<br>
Would ask the &nbsp;guard of braver arms, than such<br>
As only care to have their coffers fill'd."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My liege, it doth enhance the joy thy words<br>
Infuse into me, mighty as it is,<br>
To think my gladness manifest to thee,<br>
As to myself, who own it, when thou lookst<br>
Into the source and limit of all good,<br>
There, where thou markest that which thou dost speak,<br>
Thence priz'd of me the more. &nbsp;Glad thou hast made me.<br>
Now make intelligent, clearing the doubt<br>
Thy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse,<br>
How bitter can spring up, when sweet is sown."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thus inquiring; he forthwith replied:<br>
"If I have power to show one truth, soon that<br>
Shall face thee, which thy questioning declares<br>
Behind thee now conceal'd. &nbsp;The Good, that guides<br>
And blessed makes this realm, which thou dost mount,<br>
Ordains its providence to be the virtue<br>
In these great bodies: nor th' all perfect Mind<br>
Upholds their nature merely, but in them<br>
Their energy to save: for nought, that lies<br>
Within the range of that unerring bow,<br>
But is as level with the destin'd aim,<br>
As ever mark to arrow's point oppos'd.<br>
Were it not thus, these heavens, thou dost visit,<br>
Would their effect so work, it would not be<br>
Art, but destruction; and this may not chance,<br>
If th' intellectual powers, that move these stars,<br>
Fail not, or who, first faulty made them fail.<br>
Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc'd?"<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom I thus: "It is enough: no fear,<br>
I see, lest nature in her part should tire."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He straight rejoin'd: "Say, were it worse for man,<br>
If he liv'd not in fellowship on earth?"<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea," answer'd I; "nor here a reason needs."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And may that be, if different estates<br>
Grow not of different duties in your life?<br>
Consult your teacher, and he tells you 'no."'<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus did he come, deducing to this point,<br>
And then concluded: "For this cause behooves,<br>
The roots, from whence your operations come,<br>
Must differ. &nbsp;Therefore one is Solon born;<br>
Another, Xerxes; and Melchisidec<br>
A third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage<br>
Cost him his son. &nbsp;In her circuitous course,<br>
Nature, that is the seal to mortal wax,<br>
Doth well her art, but no distinctions owns<br>
'Twixt one or other household. &nbsp;Hence befalls<br>
That Esau is so wide of Jacob: hence<br>
Quirinus of so base a father springs,<br>
He dates from Mars his lineage. &nbsp;Were it not<br>
That providence celestial overrul'd,<br>
Nature, in generation, must the path<br>
Trac'd by the generator, still pursue<br>
Unswervingly. &nbsp;Thus place I in thy sight<br>
That, which was late behind thee. &nbsp;But, in sign<br>
Of more affection for thee, 't is my will<br>
Thou wear this corollary. &nbsp;Nature ever<br>
Finding discordant fortune, like all seed<br>
Out of its proper climate, thrives but ill.<br>
And were the world below content to mark<br>
And work on the foundation nature lays,<br>
It would not lack supply of excellence.<br>
But ye perversely to religion strain<br>
Him, who was born to gird on him the sword,<br>
And of the fluent phrasemen make your king;<br>
Therefore your steps have wander'd from the paths."</p>

<h2>CANTO IX</h2>
<br>

<p>After solution of my doubt, thy Charles,<br>
O fair Clemenza, of the treachery spake<br>
That must befall his seed: but, "Tell it not,"<br>
Said he, "and let the destin'd years come round."<br>
Nor may I tell thee more, save that the meed<br>
Of sorrow well-deserv'd shall quit your wrongs.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the visage of that saintly light<br>
Was to the sun, that fills it, turn'd again,<br>
As to the good, whose plenitude of bliss<br>
Sufficeth all. &nbsp;O ye misguided souls!<br>
Infatuate, who from such a good estrange<br>
Your hearts, and bend your gaze on vanity,<br>
Alas for you!&mdash;And lo! toward me, next,<br>
Another of those splendent forms approach'd,<br>
That, by its outward bright'ning, testified<br>
The will it had to pleasure me. &nbsp;The eyes<br>
Of Beatrice, resting, as before,<br>
Firmly upon me, manifested forth<br>
Approval of my wish. &nbsp;"And O," I cried,<br>
"Blest spirit! quickly be my will perform'd;<br>
And prove thou to me, that my inmost thoughts<br>
I can reflect on thee." &nbsp;Thereat the light,<br>
That yet was new to me, from the recess,<br>
Where it before was singing, thus began,<br>
As one who joys in kindness: "In that part<br>
Of the deprav'd Italian land, which lies<br>
Between Rialto, and the fountain-springs<br>
Of Brenta and of Piava, there doth rise,<br>
But to no lofty eminence, a hill,<br>
From whence erewhile a firebrand did descend,<br>
That sorely sheet the region. &nbsp;From one root<br>
I and it sprang; my name on earth Cunizza:<br>
And here I glitter, for that by its light<br>
This star o'ercame me. &nbsp;Yet I naught repine,<br>
Nor grudge myself the cause of this my lot,<br>
Which haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This jewel, that is next me in our heaven,<br>
Lustrous and costly, great renown hath left,<br>
And not to perish, ere these hundred years<br>
Five times absolve their round. &nbsp;Consider thou,<br>
If to excel be worthy man's endeavour,<br>
When such life may attend the first. &nbsp;Yet they<br>
Care not for this, the crowd that now are girt<br>
By Adice and Tagliamento, still<br>
Impenitent, tho' scourg'd. &nbsp;The hour is near,<br>
When for their stubbornness at Padua's marsh<br>
The water shall be chang'd, that laves Vicena<br>
And where Cagnano meets with Sile, one<br>
Lords it, and bears his head aloft, for whom<br>
The web is now a-warping. &nbsp;Feltro too<br>
Shall sorrow for its godless shepherd's fault,<br>
Of so deep stain, that never, for the like,<br>
Was Malta's bar unclos'd. &nbsp;Too large should be<br>
The skillet, that would hold Ferrara's blood,<br>
And wearied he, who ounce by ounce would weight it,<br>
The which this priest, in show of party-zeal,<br>
Courteous will give; nor will the gift ill suit<br>
The country's custom. &nbsp;We descry above,<br>
Mirrors, ye call them thrones, from which to us<br>
Reflected shine the judgments of our God:<br>
Whence these our sayings we avouch for good."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ended, and appear'd on other thoughts<br>
Intent, re-ent'ring on the wheel she late<br>
Had left. &nbsp;That other joyance meanwhile wax'd<br>
A thing to marvel at, in splendour glowing,<br>
Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun,<br>
For, in that upper clime, effulgence comes<br>
Of gladness, as here laughter: and below,<br>
As the mind saddens, murkier grows the shade.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God seeth all: and in him is thy sight,"<br>
Said I, "blest Spirit! &nbsp;Therefore will of his<br>
Cannot to thee be dark. &nbsp;Why then delays<br>
Thy voice to satisfy my wish untold,<br>
That voice which joins the inexpressive song,<br>
Pastime of heav'n, the which those ardours sing,<br>
That cowl them with six shadowing wings outspread?<br>
I would not wait thy asking, wert thou known<br>
To me, as thoroughly I to thee am known."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He forthwith answ'ring, thus his words began:<br>
"The valley' of waters, widest next to that<br>
Which doth the earth engarland, shapes its course,<br>
Between discordant shores, against the sun<br>
Inward so far, it makes meridian there,<br>
Where was before th' horizon. &nbsp;Of that vale<br>
Dwelt I upon the shore, 'twixt Ebro's stream<br>
And Macra's, that divides with passage brief<br>
Genoan bounds from Tuscan. &nbsp;East and west<br>
Are nearly one to Begga and my land,<br>
Whose haven erst was with its own blood warm.<br>
Who knew my name were wont to call me Folco:<br>
And I did bear impression of this heav'n,<br>
That now bears mine: for not with fiercer flame<br>
Glow'd Belus' daughter, injuring alike<br>
Sichaeus and Creusa, than did I,<br>
Long as it suited the unripen'd down<br>
That fledg'd my cheek: nor she of Rhodope,<br>
That was beguiled of Demophoon;<br>
Nor Jove's son, when the charms of Iole<br>
Were shrin'd within his heart. &nbsp;And yet there hides<br>
No sorrowful repentance here, but mirth,<br>
Not for the fault (that doth not come to mind),<br>
But for the virtue, whose o'erruling sway<br>
And providence have wrought thus quaintly. &nbsp;Here<br>
The skill is look'd into, that fashioneth<br>
With such effectual working, and the good<br>
Discern'd, accruing to this upper world<br>
From that below. &nbsp;But fully to content<br>
Thy wishes, all that in this sphere have birth,<br>
Demands my further parle. &nbsp;Inquire thou wouldst,<br>
Who of this light is denizen, that here<br>
Beside me sparkles, as the sun-beam doth<br>
On the clear wave. &nbsp;Know then, the soul of Rahab<br>
Is in that gladsome harbour, to our tribe<br>
United, and the foremost rank assign'd.<br>
He to that heav'n, at which the shadow ends<br>
Of your sublunar world, was taken up,<br>
First, in Christ's triumph, of all souls redeem'd:<br>
For well behoov'd, that, in some part of heav'n,<br>
She should remain a trophy, to declare<br>
The mighty contest won with either palm;<br>
For that she favour'd first the high exploit<br>
Of Joshua on the holy land, whereof<br>
The Pope recks little now. &nbsp;Thy city, plant<br>
Of him, that on his Maker turn'd the back,<br>
And of whose envying so much woe hath sprung,<br>
Engenders and expands the cursed flower,<br>
That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs,<br>
Turning the shepherd to a wolf. &nbsp;For this,<br>
The gospel and great teachers laid aside,<br>
The decretals, as their stuft margins show,<br>
Are the sole study. &nbsp;Pope and Cardinals,<br>
Intent on these, ne'er journey but in thought<br>
To Nazareth, where Gabriel op'd his wings.<br>
Yet it may chance, erelong, the Vatican,<br>
And other most selected parts of Rome,<br>
That were the grave of Peter's soldiery,<br>
Shall be deliver'd from the adult'rous bond."</p>

<h2>CANTO X</h2>
<br>

<p>Looking into his first-born with the love,<br>
Which breathes from both eternal, the first Might<br>
Ineffable, whence eye or mind<br>
Can roam, hath in such order all dispos'd,<br>
As none may see and fail to enjoy. &nbsp;Raise, then,<br>
O reader! to the lofty wheels, with me,<br>
Thy ken directed to the point, whereat<br>
One motion strikes on th' other. &nbsp;There begin<br>
Thy wonder of the mighty Architect,<br>
Who loves his work so inwardly, his eye<br>
Doth ever watch it. &nbsp;See, how thence oblique<br>
Brancheth the circle, where the planets roll<br>
To pour their wished influence on the world;<br>
Whose path not bending thus, in heav'n above<br>
Much virtue would be lost, and here on earth,<br>
All power well nigh extinct: or, from direct<br>
Were its departure distant more or less,<br>
I' th' universal order, great defect<br>
Must, both in heav'n and here beneath, ensue.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now rest thee, reader! on thy bench, and muse<br>
Anticipative of the feast to come;<br>
So shall delight make thee not feel thy toil.<br>
Lo! I have set before thee, for thyself<br>
Feed now: the matter I indite, henceforth<br>
Demands entire my thought. &nbsp;Join'd with the part,<br>
Which late we told of, the great minister<br>
Of nature, that upon the world imprints<br>
The virtue of the heaven, and doles out<br>
Time for us with his beam, went circling on<br>
Along the spires, where each hour sooner comes;<br>
And I was with him, weetless of ascent,<br>
As one, who till arriv'd, weets not his coming.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Beatrice, she who passeth on<br>
So suddenly from good to better, time<br>
Counts not the act, oh then how great must needs<br>
Have been her brightness! &nbsp;What she was i' th' sun<br>
(Where I had enter'd), not through change of hue,<br>
But light transparent&mdash;did I summon up<br>
Genius, art, practice&mdash;I might not so speak,<br>
It should be e'er imagin'd: yet believ'd<br>
It may be, and the sight be justly crav'd.<br>
And if our fantasy fail of such height,<br>
What marvel, since no eye above the sun<br>
Hath ever travel'd? &nbsp;Such are they dwell here,<br>
Fourth family of the Omnipotent Sire,<br>
Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows;<br>
And holds them still enraptur'd with the view.<br>
And thus to me Beatrice: "Thank, oh thank,<br>
The Sun of angels, him, who by his grace<br>
To this perceptible hath lifted thee."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never was heart in such devotion bound,<br>
And with complacency so absolute<br>
Dispos'd to render up itself to God,<br>
As mine was at those words: and so entire<br>
The love for Him, that held me, it eclips'd<br>
Beatrice in oblivion. &nbsp;Naught displeas'd<br>
Was she, but smil'd thereat so joyously,<br>
That of her laughing eyes the radiance brake<br>
And scatter'd my collected mind abroad.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then saw I a bright band, in liveliness<br>
Surpassing, who themselves did make the crown,<br>
And us their centre: yet more sweet in voice,<br>
Than in their visage beaming. &nbsp;Cinctur'd thus,<br>
Sometime Latona's daughter we behold,<br>
When the impregnate air retains the thread,<br>
That weaves her zone. &nbsp;In the celestial court,<br>
Whence I return, are many jewels found,<br>
So dear and beautiful, they cannot brook<br>
Transporting from that realm: and of these lights<br>
Such was the song. &nbsp;Who doth not prune his wing<br>
To soar up thither, let him look from thence<br>
For tidings from the dumb. &nbsp;When, singing thus,<br>
Those burning suns that circled round us thrice,<br>
As nearest stars around the fixed pole,<br>
Then seem'd they like to ladies, from the dance<br>
Not ceasing, but suspense, in silent pause,<br>
List'ning, till they have caught the strain anew:<br>
Suspended so they stood: and, from within,<br>
Thus heard I one, who spake: "Since with its beam<br>
The grace, whence true love lighteth first his flame,<br>
That after doth increase by loving, shines<br>
So multiplied in thee, it leads thee up<br>
Along this ladder, down whose hallow'd steps<br>
None e'er descend, and mount them not again,<br>
Who from his phial should refuse thee wine<br>
To slake thy thirst, no less constrained were,<br>
Than water flowing not unto the sea.<br>
Thou fain wouldst hear, what plants are these, that bloom<br>
In the bright garland, which, admiring, girds<br>
This fair dame round, who strengthens thee for heav'n.<br>
I then was of the lambs, that Dominic<br>
Leads, for his saintly flock, along the way,<br>
Where well they thrive, not sworn with vanity.<br>
He, nearest on my right hand, brother was,<br>
And master to me: Albert of Cologne<br>
Is this: and of Aquinum, Thomas I.<br>
If thou of all the rest wouldst be assur'd,<br>
Let thine eye, waiting on the words I speak,<br>
In circuit journey round the blessed wreath.<br>
That next resplendence issues from the smile<br>
Of Gratian, who to either forum lent<br>
Such help, as favour wins in Paradise.<br>
The other, nearest, who adorns our quire,<br>
Was Peter, he that with the widow gave<br>
To holy church his treasure. &nbsp;The fifth light,<br>
Goodliest of all, is by such love inspired,<br>
That all your world craves tidings of its doom:<br>
Within, there is the lofty light, endow'd<br>
With sapience so profound, if truth be truth,<br>
That with a ken of such wide amplitude<br>
No second hath arisen. &nbsp;Next behold<br>
That taper's radiance, to whose view was shown,<br>
Clearliest, the nature and the ministry<br>
Angelical, while yet in flesh it dwelt.<br>
In the other little light serenely smiles<br>
That pleader for the Christian temples, he<br>
Who did provide Augustin of his lore.<br>
Now, if thy mind's eye pass from light to light,<br>
Upon my praises following, of the eighth<br>
Thy thirst is next. &nbsp;The saintly soul, that shows<br>
The world's deceitfulness, to all who hear him,<br>
Is, with the sight of all the good, that is,<br>
Blest there. &nbsp;The limbs, whence it was driven, lie<br>
Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom<br>
And exile came it here. &nbsp;Lo! further on,<br>
Where flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore,<br>
Of Bede, and Richard, more than man, erewhile,<br>
In deep discernment. &nbsp;Lastly this, from whom<br>
Thy look on me reverteth, was the beam<br>
Of one, whose spirit, on high musings bent,<br>
Rebuk'd the ling'ring tardiness of death.<br>
It is the eternal light of Sigebert,<br>
Who 'scap'd not envy, when of truth he argued,<br>
Reading in the straw-litter'd street." &nbsp;Forthwith,<br>
As clock, that calleth up the spouse of God<br>
To win her bridegroom's love at matin's hour,<br>
Each part of other fitly drawn and urg'd,<br>
Sends out a tinkling sound, of note so sweet,<br>
Affection springs in well-disposed breast;<br>
Thus saw I move the glorious wheel, thus heard<br>
Voice answ'ring voice, so musical and soft,<br>
It can be known but where day endless shines.</p>

<p>O fond anxiety of mortal men!<br>
How vain and inconclusive arguments<br>
Are those, which make thee beat thy wings below<br>
For statues one, and one for aphorisms<br>
Was hunting; this the priesthood follow'd, that<br>
By force or sophistry aspir'd to rule;<br>
To rob another, and another sought<br>
By civil business wealth; one moiling lay<br>
Tangled in net of sensual delight,<br>
And one to witless indolence resign'd;<br>
What time from all these empty things escap'd,<br>
With Beatrice, I thus gloriously<br>
Was rais'd aloft, and made the guest of heav'n.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They of the circle to that point, each one.<br>
Where erst it was, had turn'd; and steady glow'd,<br>
As candle in his socket. &nbsp;Then within<br>
The lustre, that erewhile bespake me, smiling<br>
With merer gladness, heard I thus begin:<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"E'en as his beam illumes me, so I look<br>
Into the eternal light, and clearly mark<br>
Thy thoughts, from whence they rise. &nbsp;Thou art in doubt,<br>
And wouldst, that I should bolt my words afresh<br>
In such plain open phrase, as may be smooth<br>
To thy perception, where I told thee late<br>
That 'well they thrive;' and that 'no second such<br>
Hath risen,' which no small distinction needs.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The providence, that governeth the world,<br>
In depth of counsel by created ken<br>
Unfathomable, to the end that she,<br>
Who with loud cries was 'spous'd in precious blood,<br>
Might keep her footing towards her well-belov'd,<br>
Safe in herself and constant unto him,<br>
Hath two ordain'd, who should on either hand<br>
In chief escort her: one seraphic all<br>
In fervency; for wisdom upon earth,<br>
The other splendour of cherubic light.<br>
I but of one will tell: he tells of both,<br>
Who one commendeth which of them so'er<br>
Be taken: for their deeds were to one end.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Between Tupino, and the wave, that falls<br>
From blest Ubaldo's chosen hill, there hangs<br>
Rich slope of mountain high, whence heat and cold<br>
Are wafted through Perugia's eastern gate:<br>
And Norcera with Gualdo, in its rear<br>
Mourn for their heavy yoke. &nbsp;Upon that side,<br>
Where it doth break its steepness most, arose<br>
A sun upon the world, as duly this<br>
From Ganges doth: therefore let none, who speak<br>
Of that place, say Ascesi; for its name<br>
Were lamely so deliver'd; but the East,<br>
To call things rightly, be it henceforth styl'd.<br>
He was not yet much distant from his rising,<br>
When his good influence 'gan to bless the earth.<br>
A dame to whom none openeth pleasure's gate<br>
More than to death, was, 'gainst his father's will,<br>
His stripling choice: and he did make her his,<br>
Before the Spiritual court, by nuptial bonds,<br>
And in his father's sight: from day to day,<br>
Then lov'd her more devoutly. &nbsp;She, bereav'd<br>
Of her first husband, slighted and obscure,<br>
Thousand and hundred years and more, remain'd<br>
Without a single suitor, till he came.<br>
Nor aught avail'd, that, with Amyclas, she<br>
Was found unmov'd at rumour of his voice,<br>
Who shook the world: nor aught her constant boldness<br>
Whereby with Christ she mounted on the cross,<br>
When Mary stay'd beneath. &nbsp;But not to deal<br>
Thus closely with thee longer, take at large<br>
The rovers' titles&mdash;Poverty and Francis.<br>
Their concord and glad looks, wonder and love,<br>
And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts,<br>
So much, that venerable Bernard first<br>
Did bare his feet, and, in pursuit of peace<br>
So heavenly, ran, yet deem'd his footing slow.<br>
O hidden riches! &nbsp;O prolific good!<br>
Egidius bares him next, and next Sylvester,<br>
And follow both the bridegroom; so the bride<br>
Can please them. &nbsp;Thenceforth goes he on his way,<br>
The father and the master, with his spouse,<br>
And with that family, whom now the cord<br>
Girt humbly: nor did abjectness of heart<br>
Weigh down his eyelids, for that he was son<br>
Of Pietro Bernardone, and by men<br>
In wond'rous sort despis'd. &nbsp;But royally<br>
His hard intention he to Innocent<br>
Set forth, and from him first receiv'd the seal<br>
On his religion. &nbsp;Then, when numerous flock'd<br>
The tribe of lowly ones, that trac'd HIS steps,<br>
Whose marvellous life deservedly were sung<br>
In heights empyreal, through Honorius' hand<br>
A second crown, to deck their Guardian's virtues,<br>
Was by the eternal Spirit inwreath'd: and when<br>
He had, through thirst of martyrdom, stood up<br>
In the proud Soldan's presence, and there preach'd<br>
Christ and his followers; but found the race<br>
Unripen'd for conversion: back once more<br>
He hasted (not to intermit his toil),<br>
And reap'd Ausonian lands. &nbsp;On the hard rock,<br>
'Twixt Arno and the Tyber, he from Christ<br>
Took the last Signet, which his limbs two years<br>
Did carry. &nbsp;Then the season come, that he,<br>
Who to such good had destin'd him, was pleas'd<br>
T' advance him to the meed, which he had earn'd<br>
By his self-humbling, to his brotherhood,<br>
As their just heritage, he gave in charge<br>
His dearest lady, and enjoin'd their love<br>
And faith to her: and, from her bosom, will'd<br>
His goodly spirit should move forth, returning<br>
To its appointed kingdom, nor would have<br>
His body laid upon another bier.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think now of one, who were a fit colleague,<br>
To keep the bark of Peter in deep sea<br>
Helm'd to right point; and such our Patriarch was.<br>
Therefore who follow him, as he enjoins,<br>
Thou mayst be certain, take good lading in.<br>
But hunger of new viands tempts his flock,<br>
So that they needs into strange pastures wide<br>
Must spread them: and the more remote from him<br>
The stragglers wander, so much mole they come<br>
Home to the sheep-fold, destitute of milk.<br>
There are of them, in truth, who fear their harm,<br>
And to the shepherd cleave; but these so few,<br>
A little stuff may furnish out their cloaks.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, if my words be clear, if thou have ta'en<br>
Good heed, if that, which I have told, recall<br>
To mind, thy wish may be in part fulfill'd:<br>
For thou wilt see the point from whence they split,<br>
Nor miss of the reproof, which that implies,<br>
'That well they thrive not sworn with vanity."'</p>

<p>Soon as its final word the blessed flame<br>
Had rais'd for utterance, straight the holy mill<br>
Began to wheel, nor yet had once revolv'd,<br>
Or ere another, circling, compass'd it,<br>
Motion to motion, song to song, conjoining,<br>
Song, that as much our muses doth excel,<br>
Our Sirens with their tuneful pipes, as ray<br>
Of primal splendour doth its faint reflex.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when, if Juno bid her handmaid forth,<br>
Two arches parallel, and trick'd alike,<br>
Span the thin cloud, the outer taking birth<br>
From that within (in manner of that voice<br>
Whom love did melt away, as sun the mist),<br>
And they who gaze, presageful call to mind<br>
The compact, made with Noah, of the world<br>
No more to be o'erflow'd; about us thus<br>
Of sempiternal roses, bending, wreath'd<br>
Those garlands twain, and to the innermost<br>
E'en thus th' external answered. &nbsp;When the footing,<br>
And other great festivity, of song,<br>
And radiance, light with light accordant, each<br>
Jocund and blythe, had at their pleasure still'd<br>
(E'en as the eyes by quick volition mov'd,<br>
Are shut and rais'd together), from the heart<br>
Of one amongst the new lights mov'd a voice,<br>
That made me seem like needle to the star,<br>
In turning to its whereabout, and thus<br>
Began: "The love, that makes me beautiful,<br>
Prompts me to tell of th' other guide, for whom<br>
Such good of mine is spoken. &nbsp;Where one is,<br>
The other worthily should also be;<br>
That as their warfare was alike, alike<br>
Should be their glory. &nbsp;Slow, and full of doubt,<br>
And with thin ranks, after its banner mov'd<br>
The army of Christ (which it so clearly cost<br>
To reappoint), when its imperial Head,<br>
Who reigneth ever, for the drooping host<br>
Did make provision, thorough grace alone,<br>
And not through its deserving. &nbsp;As thou heard'st,<br>
Two champions to the succour of his spouse<br>
He sent, who by their deeds and words might join<br>
Again his scatter'd people. &nbsp;In that clime,<br>
Where springs the pleasant west-wind to unfold<br>
The fresh leaves, with which Europe sees herself<br>
New-garmented; nor from those billows far,<br>
Beyond whose chiding, after weary course,<br>
The sun doth sometimes hide him, safe abides<br>
The happy Callaroga, under guard<br>
Of the great shield, wherein the lion lies<br>
Subjected and supreme. &nbsp;And there was born<br>
The loving million of the Christian faith,<br>
The hollow'd wrestler, gentle to his own,<br>
And to his enemies terrible. &nbsp;So replete<br>
His soul with lively virtue, that when first<br>
Created, even in the mother's womb,<br>
It prophesied. &nbsp;When, at the sacred font,<br>
The spousals were complete 'twixt faith and him,<br>
Where pledge of mutual safety was exchang'd,<br>
The dame, who was his surety, in her sleep<br>
Beheld the wondrous fruit, that was from him<br>
And from his heirs to issue. &nbsp;And that such<br>
He might be construed, as indeed he was,<br>
She was inspir'd to name him of his owner,<br>
Whose he was wholly, and so call'd him Dominic.<br>
And I speak of him, as the labourer,<br>
Whom Christ in his own garden chose to be<br>
His help-mate. &nbsp;Messenger he seem'd, and friend<br>
Fast-knit to Christ; and the first love he show'd,<br>
Was after the first counsel that Christ gave.<br>
Many a time his nurse, at entering found<br>
That he had ris'n in silence, and was prostrate,<br>
As who should say, "My errand was for this."<br>
O happy father! &nbsp;Felix rightly nam'd!<br>
O favour'd mother! rightly nam'd Joanna!<br>
If that do mean, as men interpret it.<br>
Not for the world's sake, for which now they pore<br>
Upon Ostiense and Taddeo's page,<br>
But for the real manna, soon he grew<br>
Mighty in learning, and did set himself<br>
To go about the vineyard, that soon turns<br>
To wan and wither'd, if not tended well:<br>
And from the see (whose bounty to the just<br>
And needy is gone by, not through its fault,<br>
But his who fills it basely, he besought,<br>
No dispensation for commuted wrong,<br>
Nor the first vacant fortune, nor the tenth),<br>
That to God's paupers rightly appertain,<br>
But, 'gainst an erring and degenerate world,<br>
Licence to fight, in favour of that seed,<br>
From which the twice twelve cions gird thee round.<br>
Then, with sage doctrine and good will to help,<br>
Forth on his great apostleship he far'd,<br>
Like torrent bursting from a lofty vein;<br>
And, dashing 'gainst the stocks of heresy,<br>
Smote fiercest, where resistance was most stout.<br>
Thence many rivulets have since been turn'd,<br>
Over the garden Catholic to lead<br>
Their living waters, and have fed its plants.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If such one wheel of that two-yoked car,<br>

So courteously unto thee. &nbsp;But the track,<br>
Which its smooth fellies made, is now deserted:<br>
That mouldy mother is where late were lees.<br>
His family, that wont to trace his path,<br>
Turn backward, and invert their steps; erelong<br>
To rue the gathering in of their ill crop,<br>
When the rejected tares in vain shall ask<br>
Admittance to the barn. &nbsp;I question not<br>

Might still find page with this inscription on't,<br>

Of my great offices still laid aside<br>
All sinister aim. &nbsp;Illuminato here,<br>

Among the first of those barefooted meek ones,<br>
Who sought God's friendship in the cord: with them<br>
Hugues of Saint Victor, Pietro Mangiadore,<br>

<h2>CANTO XIII</h2>

<p>Let him, who would conceive what now I saw,<br>
Imagine (and retain the image firm,<br>
As mountain rock, the whilst he hears me speak),<br>
Of stars fifteen, from midst the ethereal host<br>
Selected, that, with lively ray serene,<br>
O'ercome the massiest air: thereto imagine<br>
The wain, that, in the bosom of our sky,<br>
Spins ever on its axle night and day,<br>
With the bright summit of that horn which swells<br>
Due from the pole, round which the first wheel rolls,<br>
T' have rang'd themselves in fashion of two signs<br>
In heav'n, such as Ariadne made,<br>
When death's chill seized her; and that one of them<br>
Did compass in the other's beam; and both<br>
In such sort whirl around, that each should tend<br>
With opposite motion and, conceiving thus,<br>
Of that true constellation, and the dance<br>
Twofold, that circled me, he shall attain<br>
As 't were the shadow; for things there as much<br>
Surpass our usage, as the swiftest heav'n<br>
Is swifter than the Chiana. &nbsp;There was sung<br>
No Bacchus, and no Io Paean, but<br>
Three Persons in the Godhead, and in one<br>
Substance that nature and the human join'd.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song fulfill'd its measure; and to us<br>
Those saintly lights attended, happier made<br>
At each new minist'ring. &nbsp;Then silence brake,<br>
Amid th' accordant sons of Deity,<br>
That luminary, in which the wondrous life<br>
Of the meek man of God was told to me;<br>
And thus it spake: "One ear o' th' harvest thresh'd,<br>
And its grain safely stor'd, sweet charity<br>
Invites me with the other to like toil.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou know'st, that in the bosom, whence the rib<br>
Was ta'en to fashion that fair cheek, whose taste<br>
All the world pays for, and in that, which pierc'd<br>
By the keen lance, both after and before<br>
Such satisfaction offer'd, as outweighs<br>
Each evil in the scale, whate'er of light<br>
To human nature is allow'd, must all<br>
Have by his virtue been infus'd, who form'd<br>
Both one and other: and thou thence admir'st<br>
In that I told thee, of beatitudes<br>
A second, there is none, to his enclos'd<br>
In the fifth radiance. &nbsp;Open now thine eyes<br>
To what I answer thee; and thou shalt see<br>
Thy deeming and my saying meet in truth,<br>
As centre in the round. &nbsp;That which dies not,<br>
And that which can die, are but each the beam<br>
Of that idea, which our Soverign Sire<br>
Engendereth loving; for that lively light,<br>
Which passeth from his brightness; not disjoin'd<br>
From him, nor from his love triune with them,<br>
Doth, through his bounty, congregate itself,<br>
Mirror'd, as 't were in new existences,<br>
Itself unalterable and ever one.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Descending hence unto the lowest powers,<br>
Its energy so sinks, at last it makes<br>
But brief contingencies: for so I name<br>
Things generated, which the heav'nly orbs<br>
Moving, with seed or without seed, produce.<br>
Their wax, and that which molds it, differ much:<br>
And thence with lustre, more or less, it shows<br>
Th' ideal stamp impress: so that one tree<br>
According to his kind, hath better fruit,<br>
And worse: and, at your birth, ye, mortal men,<br>
Are in your talents various. &nbsp;Were the wax<br>
Molded with nice exactness, and the heav'n<br>
In its disposing influence supreme,<br>
The lustre of the seal should be complete:<br>
But nature renders it imperfect ever,<br>
Resembling thus the artist in her work,<br>
Whose faultering hand is faithless to his skill.<br>
Howe'er, if love itself dispose, and mark<br>
The primal virtue, kindling with bright view,<br>
There all perfection is vouchsafed; and such<br>
The clay was made, accomplish'd with each gift,<br>
That life can teem with; such the burden fill'd<br>
The virgin's bosom: so that I commend<br>
Thy judgment, that the human nature ne'er<br>
Was or can be, such as in them it was.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did I advance no further than this point,<br>
'How then had he no peer?' &nbsp;thou might'st reply.<br>
But, that what now appears not, may appear<br>
Right plainly, ponder, who he was, and what<br>
(When he was bidden 'Ask' ), the motive sway'd<br>
To his requesting. &nbsp;I have spoken thus,<br>
That thou mayst see, he was a king, who ask'd<br>
For wisdom, to the end he might be king<br>
Sufficient: not the number to search out<br>
Of the celestial movers; or to know,<br>
If necessary with contingent e'er<br>
Have made necessity; or whether that<br>
Be granted, that first motion is; or if<br>
Of the mid circle can, by art, be made<br>
Triangle with each corner, blunt or sharp.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whence, noting that, which I have said, and this,<br>
Thou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn,<br>
At which the dart of my intention aims.<br>
And, marking clearly, that I told thee, 'Risen,'<br>
Thou shalt discern it only hath respect<br>
To kings, of whom are many, and the good<br>
Are rare. &nbsp;With this distinction take my words;<br>
And they may well consist with that which thou<br>
Of the first human father dost believe,<br>
And of our well-beloved. &nbsp;And let this<br>
Henceforth be led unto thy feet, to make<br>
Thee slow in motion, as a weary man,<br>
Both to the 'yea' and to the 'nay' thou seest not.<br>
For he among the fools is down full low,<br>
Whose affirmation, or denial, is<br>
Without distinction, in each case alike<br>
Since it befalls, that in most instances<br>
Current opinion leads to false: and then<br>
Affection bends the judgment to her ply.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Much more than vainly doth he loose from shore,<br>
Since he returns not such as he set forth,<br>
Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill.<br>
And open proofs of this unto the world<br>
Have been afforded in Parmenides,<br>
Melissus, Bryso, and the crowd beside,<br>
Who journey'd on, and knew not whither: so did<br>
Sabellius, Arius, and the other fools,<br>
Who, like to scymitars, reflected back<br>
The scripture-image, by distortion marr'd.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let not the people be too swift to judge,<br>
As one who reckons on the blades in field,<br>
Or ere the crop be ripe. &nbsp;For I have seen<br>
The thorn frown rudely all the winter long<br>
And after bear the rose upon its top;<br>
And bark, that all the way across the sea<br>
Ran straight and speedy, perish at the last,<br>
E'en in the haven's mouth seeing one steal,<br>
Another brine, his offering to the priest,<br>
Let not Dame Birtha and Sir Martin thence<br>
Into heav'n's counsels deem that they can pry:<br>
For one of these may rise, the other fall."</p>

<p>From centre to the circle, and so back<br>
From circle to the centre, water moves<br>
In the round chalice, even as the blow<br>
Impels it, inwardly, or from without.<br>
Such was the image glanc'd into my mind,<br>
As the great spirit of Aquinum ceas'd;<br>
And Beatrice after him her words<br>
Resum'd alternate: "Need there is (tho' yet<br>
He tells it to you not in words, nor e'en<br>
In thought) that he should fathom to its depth<br>
Another mystery. &nbsp;Tell him, if the light,<br>
Wherewith your substance blooms, shall stay with you<br>
Eternally, as now: and, if it doth,<br>
How, when ye shall regain your visible forms,<br>
The sight may without harm endure the change,<br>
That also tell." &nbsp;As those, who in a ring<br>
Tread the light measure, in their fitful mirth<br>
Raise loud the voice, and spring with gladder bound;<br>
Thus, at the hearing of that pious suit,<br>
The saintly circles in their tourneying<br>
And wond'rous note attested new delight.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoso laments, that we must doff this garb<br>
Of frail mortality, thenceforth to live<br>
Immortally above, he hath not seen<br>
The sweet refreshing, of that heav'nly shower.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him, who lives ever, and for ever reigns<br>
In mystic union of the Three in One,<br>
Unbounded, bounding all, each spirit thrice<br>
Sang, with such melody, as but to hear<br>
For highest merit were an ample meed.<br>
And from the lesser orb the goodliest light,<br>
With gentle voice and mild, such as perhaps<br>
The angel's once to Mary, thus replied:<br>
"Long as the joy of Paradise shall last,<br>
Our love shall shine around that raiment, bright,<br>
As fervent; fervent, as in vision blest;<br>
And that as far in blessedness exceeding,<br>
As it hath grave beyond its virtue great.<br>
Our shape, regarmented with glorious weeds<br>
Of saintly flesh, must, being thus entire,<br>
Show yet more gracious. &nbsp;Therefore shall increase,<br>
Whate'er of light, gratuitous, imparts<br>
The Supreme Good; light, ministering aid,<br>
The better disclose his glory: whence<br>
The vision needs increasing, much increase<br>
The fervour, which it kindles; and that too<br>
The ray, that comes from it. &nbsp;But as the greed<br>
Which gives out flame, yet it its whiteness shines<br>
More lively than that, and so preserves<br>
Its proper semblance; thus this circling sphere<br>
Of splendour, shall to view less radiant seem,<br>
Than shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth<br>
Now covers. &nbsp;Nor will such excess of light<br>
O'erpower us, in corporeal organs made<br>
Firm, and susceptible of all delight."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So ready and so cordial an "Amen,"<br>
Followed from either choir, as plainly spoke<br>
Desire of their dead bodies; yet perchance<br>
Not for themselves, but for their kindred dear,<br>
Mothers and sires, and those whom best they lov'd,<br>
Ere they were made imperishable flame.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lo! forthwith there rose up round about<br>
A lustre over that already there,<br>
Of equal clearness, like the brightening up<br>
Of the horizon. &nbsp;As at an evening hour<br>
Of twilight, new appearances through heav'n<br>
Peer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried;<br>
So there new substances, methought began<br>
To rise in view; and round the other twain<br>
Enwheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O gentle glitter of eternal beam!<br>
With what a such whiteness did it flow,<br>
O'erpowering vision in me! &nbsp;But so fair,<br>
So passing lovely, Beatrice show'd,<br>
Mind cannot follow it, nor words express<br>
Her infinite sweetness. &nbsp;Thence mine eyes regain'd<br>
Power to look up, and I beheld myself,<br>
Sole with my lady, to more lofty bliss<br>
Translated: for the star, with warmer smile<br>
Impurpled, well denoted our ascent.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the heart, and with that tongue which speaks<br>
The same in all, an holocaust I made<br>
To God, befitting the new grace vouchsaf'd.<br>
And from my bosom had not yet upsteam'd<br>
The fuming of that incense, when I knew<br>
The rite accepted. &nbsp;With such mighty sheen<br>
And mantling crimson, in two listed rays<br>
The splendours shot before me, that I cried,<br>

Its pathway, which the wisest fail to spell;<br>
So thickly studded, in the depth of Mars,<br>
Those rays describ'd the venerable sign,<br>
That quadrants in the round conjoining frame.<br>
Here memory mocks the toil of genius. &nbsp;Christ<br>
Beam'd on that cross; and pattern fails me now.<br>
But whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ<br>
Will pardon me for that I leave untold,<br>
When in the flecker'd dawning he shall spy<br>
The glitterance of Christ. &nbsp;From horn to horn,<br>
And 'tween the summit and the base did move<br>
Lights, scintillating, as they met and pass'd.<br>
Thus oft are seen, with ever-changeful glance,<br>
Straight or athwart, now rapid and now slow,<br>
The atomies of bodies, long or short,<br>
To move along the sunbeam, whose slant line<br>
Checkers the shadow, interpos'd by art<br>
Against the noontide heat. &nbsp;And as the chime<br>
Of minstrel music, dulcimer, and help<br>
With many strings, a pleasant dining makes<br>
To him, who heareth not distinct the note;<br>
So from the lights, which there appear'd to me,<br>
Gather'd along the cross a melody,<br>
That, indistinctly heard, with ravishment<br>
Possess'd me. &nbsp;Yet I mark'd it was a hymn<br>
Of lofty praises; for there came to me<br>
"Arise and conquer," as to one who hears<br>
And comprehends not. &nbsp;Me such ecstasy<br>
O'ercame, that never till that hour was thing<br>
That held me in so sweet imprisonment.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps my saying over bold appears,<br>
Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes,<br>
Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire.<br>
But he, who is aware those living seals<br>
Of every beauty work with quicker force,<br>
The higher they are ris'n; and that there<br>
I had not turn'd me to them; he may well<br>
Excuse me that, whereof in my excuse<br>
I do accuse me, and may own my truth;<br>
That holy pleasure here not yet reveal'd,<br>
Which grows in transport as we mount aloof.</p>
