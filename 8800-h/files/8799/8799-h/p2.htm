<h2>CANTO XV</h2>
<br>

<p>True love, that ever shows itself as clear<br>
In kindness, as loose appetite in wrong,<br>
Silenced that lyre harmonious, and still'd<br>
The sacred chords, that are by heav'n's right hand<br>
Unwound and tighten'd, flow to righteous prayers<br>
Should they not hearken, who, to give me will<br>
For praying, in accordance thus were mute?<br>
He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief,<br>
Who, for the love of thing that lasteth not,<br>
Despoils himself forever of that love.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As oft along the still and pure serene,<br>
At nightfall, glides a sudden trail of fire,<br>
Attracting with involuntary heed<br>
The eye to follow it, erewhile at rest,<br>
And seems some star that shifted place in heav'n,<br>
Only that, whence it kindles, none is lost,<br>
And it is soon extinct; thus from the horn,<br>
That on the dexter of the cross extends,<br>
Down to its foot, one luminary ran<br>
From mid the cluster shone there; yet no gem<br>
Dropp'd from its foil; and through the beamy list<br>
Like flame in alabaster, glow'd its course.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So forward stretch'd him (if of credence aught<br>
Our greater muse may claim) the pious ghost<br>
Of old Anchises, in the' Elysian bower,<br>
When he perceiv'd his son. &nbsp;"O thou, my blood!<br>
O most exceeding grace divine! to whom,<br>
As now to thee, hath twice the heav'nly gate<br>
Been e'er unclos'd?" so spake the light; whence I<br>
Turn'd me toward him; then unto my dame<br>
My sight directed, and on either side<br>
Amazement waited me; for in her eyes<br>
Was lighted such a smile, I thought that mine<br>
Had div'd unto the bottom of my grace<br>
And of my bliss in Paradise. &nbsp;Forthwith<br>
To hearing and to sight grateful alike,<br>
The spirit to his proem added things<br>
I understood not, so profound he spake;<br>
Yet not of choice but through necessity<br>
Mysterious; for his high conception scar'd<br>
Beyond the mark of mortals. &nbsp;When the flight<br>
Of holy transport had so spent its rage,<br>
That nearer to the level of our thought<br>
The speech descended, the first sounds I heard<br>
Were, "Best he thou, Triunal Deity!<br>
That hast such favour in my seed vouchsaf'd!"<br>
Then follow'd: "No unpleasant thirst, tho' long,<br>
Which took me reading in the sacred book,<br>
Whose leaves or white or dusky never change,<br>
Thou hast allay'd, my son, within this light,<br>
From whence my voice thou hear'st; more thanks to her.<br>
Who for such lofty mounting has with plumes<br>
Begirt thee. &nbsp;Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me<br>
From him transmitted, who is first of all,<br>
E'en as all numbers ray from unity;<br>
And therefore dost not ask me who I am,<br>
Or why to thee more joyous I appear,<br>
Than any other in this gladsome throng.<br>
The truth is as thou deem'st; for in this hue<br>
Both less and greater in that mirror look,<br>
In which thy thoughts, or ere thou think'st, are shown.<br>
But, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever,<br>
Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire,<br>
May be contended fully, let thy voice,<br>
Fearless, and frank and jocund, utter forth<br>
Thy will distinctly, utter forth the wish,<br>
Whereto my ready answer stands decreed."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn'd me to Beatrice; and she heard<br>
Ere I had spoken, smiling, an assent,<br>
That to my will gave wings; and I began<br>
"To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn'd<br>
The nature, in whom naught unequal dwells,<br>
Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt;<br>
For that they are so equal in the sun,<br>
From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat,<br>
As makes all likeness scant. &nbsp;But will and means,<br>
In mortals, for the cause ye well discern,<br>
With unlike wings are fledge. &nbsp;A mortal I<br>
Experience inequality like this,<br>
And therefore give no thanks, but in the heart,<br>
For thy paternal greeting. &nbsp;This howe'er<br>
I pray thee, living topaz! that ingemm'st<br>
This precious jewel, let me hear thy name."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am thy root, O leaf! whom to expect<br>
Even, hath pleas'd me:" &nbsp;thus the prompt reply<br>
Prefacing, next it added: "he, of whom<br>
Thy kindred appellation comes, and who,<br>
These hundred years and more, on its first ledge<br>
Hath circuited the mountain, was my son<br>
And thy great grandsire. &nbsp;Well befits, his long<br>
Endurance should be shorten'd by thy deeds.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Florence, within her ancient limit-mark,<br>
Which calls her still to matin prayers and noon,<br>
Was chaste and sober, and abode in peace.<br>
She had no armlets and no head-tires then,<br>
No purfled dames, no zone, that caught the eye<br>
More than the person did. &nbsp;Time was not yet,<br>
When at his daughter's birth the sire grew pale.<br>
For fear the age and dowry should exceed<br>
On each side just proportion. &nbsp;House was none<br>
Void of its family; nor yet had come<br>
Hardanapalus, to exhibit feats<br>
Of chamber prowess. &nbsp;Montemalo yet<br>
O'er our suburban turret rose; as much<br>
To be surpass in fall, as in its rising.<br>
I saw Bellincione Berti walk abroad<br>
In leathern girdle and a clasp of bone;<br>
And, with no artful colouring on her cheeks,<br>
His lady leave the glass. &nbsp;The sons I saw<br>
Of Nerli and of Vecchio well content<br>
With unrob'd jerkin; and their good dames handling<br>
The spindle and the flax; O happy they!<br>
Each sure of burial in her native land,<br>
And none left desolate a-bed for France!<br>
One wak'd to tend the cradle, hushing it<br>
With sounds that lull'd the parent's infancy:<br>
Another, with her maidens, drawing off<br>
The tresses from the distaff, lectur'd them<br>
Old tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome.<br>
A Salterello and Cianghella we<br>
Had held as strange a marvel, as ye would<br>
A Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In such compos'd and seemly fellowship,<br>
Such faithful and such fair equality,<br>
In so sweet household, Mary at my birth<br>
Bestow'd me, call'd on with loud cries; and there<br>
In your old baptistery, I was made<br>
Christian at once and Cacciaguida; as were<br>
My brethren, Eliseo and Moronto.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From Valdipado came to me my spouse,<br>
And hence thy surname grew. &nbsp;I follow'd then<br>
The Emperor Conrad; and his knighthood he<br>
Did gird on me; in such good part he took<br>
My valiant service. &nbsp;After him I went<br>
To testify against that evil law,<br>
Whose people, by the shepherd's fault, possess<br>
Your right, usurping. &nbsp;There, by that foul crew<br>
Was I releas'd from the deceitful world,<br>
Whose base affection many a spirit soils,<br>
And from the martyrdom came to this peace."</p>

<br><br>
<h2>CANTO XVI</h2>
<br>

<p>O slight respect of man's nobility!<br>
I never shall account it marvelous,<br>
That our infirm affection here below<br>
Thou mov'st to boasting, when I could not choose,<br>
E'en in that region of unwarp'd desire,<br>
In heav'n itself, but make my vaunt in thee!<br>
Yet cloak thou art soon shorten'd, for that time,<br>
Unless thou be eked out from day to day,<br>
Goes round thee with his shears. &nbsp;Resuming then<br>
With greeting such, as Rome, was first to bear,<br>
But since hath disaccustom'd I began;<br>
And Beatrice, that a little space<br>
Was sever'd, smil'd reminding me of her,<br>
Whose cough embolden'd (as the story holds)<br>
To first offence the doubting Guenever.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are my sire," said I, "you give me heart<br>
Freely to speak my thought: above myself<br>
You raise me. &nbsp;Through so many streams with joy<br>
My soul is fill'd, that gladness wells from it;<br>
So that it bears the mighty tide, and bursts not<br>
Say then, my honour'd stem! what ancestors<br>
Where those you sprang from, and what years were mark'd<br>
In your first childhood? &nbsp;Tell me of the fold,<br>
That hath Saint John for guardian, what was then<br>
Its state, and who in it were highest seated?"<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As embers, at the breathing of the wind,<br>
Their flame enliven, so that light I saw<br>
Shine at my blandishments; and, as it grew<br>
More fair to look on, so with voice more sweet,<br>
Yet not in this our modern phrase, forthwith<br>
It answer'd: "From the day, when it was said<br>
'Hail Virgin!' to the throes, by which my mother,<br>
Who now is sainted, lighten'd her of me<br>
Whom she was heavy with, this fire had come,<br>
Five hundred fifty times and thrice, its beams<br>
To reilumine underneath the foot<br>
Of its own lion. &nbsp;They, of whom I sprang,<br>
And I, had there our birth-place, where the last<br>
Partition of our city first is reach'd<br>
By him, that runs her annual game. &nbsp;Thus much<br>
Suffice of my forefathers: who they were,<br>
And whence they hither came, more honourable<br>
It is to pass in silence than to tell.<br>
All those, who in that time were there from Mars<br>
Until the Baptist, fit to carry arms,<br>
Were but the fifth of them this day alive.<br>
But then the citizen's blood, that now is mix'd<br>
From Campi and Certaldo and Fighine,<br>
Ran purely through the last mechanic's veins.<br>
O how much better were it, that these people<br>
Were neighbours to you, and that at Galluzzo<br>
And at Trespiano, ye should have your bound'ry,<br>
Than to have them within, and bear the stench<br>
Of Aguglione's hind, and Signa's, him,<br>
That hath his eye already keen for bart'ring!<br>
Had not the people, which of all the world<br>
Degenerates most, been stepdame unto Caesar,<br>
But, as a mother, gracious to her son;<br>
Such one, as hath become a Florentine,<br>
And trades and traffics, had been turn'd adrift<br>
To Simifonte, where his grandsire ply'd<br>
The beggar's craft. &nbsp;The Conti were possess'd<br>
Of Montemurlo still: the Cerchi still<br>
Were in Acone's parish; nor had haply<br>
From Valdigrieve past the Buondelmonte.<br>
The city's malady hath ever source<br>
In the confusion of its persons, as<br>
The body's, in variety of food:<br>
And the blind bull falls with a steeper plunge,<br>
Than the blind lamb; and oftentimes one sword<br>
Doth more and better execution,<br>
Than five. &nbsp;Mark Luni, Urbisaglia mark,<br>
How they are gone, and after them how go<br>
Chiusi and Sinigaglia; and 't will seem<br>
No longer new or strange to thee to hear,<br>
That families fail, when cities have their end.<br>
All things, that appertain t' ye, like yourselves,<br>
Are mortal: but mortality in some<br>
Ye mark not, they endure so long, and you<br>
Pass by so suddenly. &nbsp;And as the moon<br>
Doth, by the rolling of her heav'nly sphere,<br>
Hide and reveal the strand unceasingly;<br>
So fortune deals with Florence. &nbsp;Hence admire not<br>
At what of them I tell thee, whose renown<br>
Time covers, the first Florentines. &nbsp;I saw<br>
The Ughi, Catilini and Filippi,<br>
The Alberichi, Greci and Ormanni,<br>
Now in their wane, illustrious citizens:<br>
And great as ancient, of Sannella him,<br>
With him of Arca saw, and Soldanieri<br>
And Ardinghi, and Bostichi. &nbsp;At the poop,<br>
That now is laden with new felony,<br>
So cumb'rous it may speedily sink the bark,<br>
The Ravignani sat, of whom is sprung<br>
The County Guido, and whoso hath since<br>
His title from the fam'd Bellincione ta'en.<br>
Fair governance was yet an art well priz'd<br>
By him of Pressa: Galigaio show'd<br>
The gilded hilt and pommel, in his house.<br>
The column, cloth'd with verrey, still was seen<br>
Unshaken: the Sacchetti still were great,<br>
Giouchi, Sifanti, Galli and Barucci,<br>
With them who blush to hear the bushel nam'd.<br>
Of the Calfucci still the branchy trunk<br>
Was in its strength: and to the curule chairs<br>
Sizii and Arigucci yet were drawn.<br>
How mighty them I saw, whom since their pride<br>
Hath undone! and in all her goodly deeds<br>
Florence was by the bullets of bright gold<br>
O'erflourish'd. &nbsp;Such the sires of those, who now,<br>
As surely as your church is vacant, flock<br>
Into her consistory, and at leisure<br>
There stall them and grow fat. &nbsp;The o'erweening brood,<br>
That plays the dragon after him that flees,<br>
But unto such, as turn and show the tooth,<br>
Ay or the purse, is gentle as a lamb,<br>
Was on its rise, but yet so slight esteem'd,<br>
That Ubertino of Donati grudg'd<br>
His father-in-law should yoke him to its tribe.<br>
Already Caponsacco had descended<br>
Into the mart from Fesole: and Giuda<br>
And Infangato were good citizens.<br>
A thing incredible I tell, tho' true:<br>
The gateway, named from those of Pera, led<br>
Into the narrow circuit of your walls.<br>
Each one, who bears the sightly quarterings<br>
Of the great Baron (he whose name and worth<br>
The festival of Thomas still revives)<br>
His knighthood and his privilege retain'd;<br>
Albeit one, who borders them With gold,<br>
This day is mingled with the common herd.<br>
In Borgo yet the Gualterotti dwelt,<br>
And Importuni: well for its repose<br>
Had it still lack'd of newer neighbourhood.<br>
The house, from whence your tears have had their spring,<br>
Through the just anger that hath murder'd ye<br>
And put a period to your gladsome days,<br>
Was honour'd, it, and those consorted with it.<br>
O Buondelmonte! what ill counseling<br>
Prevail'd on thee to break the plighted bond<br>
Many, who now are weeping, would rejoice,<br>
Had God to Ema giv'n thee, the first time<br>
Thou near our city cam'st. &nbsp;But so was doom'd:<br>
On that maim'd stone set up to guard the bridge,<br>
At thy last peace, the victim, Florence! fell.<br>
With these and others like to them, I saw<br>
Florence in such assur'd tranquility,<br>
She had no cause at which to grieve: with these<br>
Saw her so glorious and so just, that ne'er<br>
The lily from the lance had hung reverse,<br>
Or through division been with vermeil dyed."</p>

<h2>CANTO XVII</h2>
<br>

<p>Such as the youth, who came to Clymene<br>
To certify himself of that reproach,<br>
Which had been fasten'd on him, (he whose end<br>
Still makes the fathers chary to their sons),<br>
E'en such was I; nor unobserv'd was such<br>
Of Beatrice, and that saintly lamp,<br>
Who had erewhile for me his station mov'd;<br>
When thus by lady: "Give thy wish free vent,<br>
That it may issue, bearing true report<br>
Of the mind's impress; not that aught thy words<br>
May to our knowledge add, but to the end,<br>
That thou mayst use thyself to own thy thirst<br>
And men may mingle for thee when they hear."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O plant! from whence I spring! rever'd and lov'd!<br>
Who soar'st so high a pitch, thou seest as clear,<br>
As earthly thought determines two obtuse<br>
In one triangle not contain'd, so clear<br>
Dost see contingencies, ere in themselves<br>
Existent, looking at the point whereto<br>
All times are present, I, the whilst I scal'd<br>
With Virgil the soul purifying mount,<br>
And visited the nether world of woe,<br>
Touching my future destiny have heard<br>
Words grievous, though I feel me on all sides<br>
Well squar'd to fortune's blows. &nbsp;Therefore my will<br>
Were satisfied to know the lot awaits me,<br>
The arrow, seen beforehand, slacks its flight."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So said I to the brightness, which erewhile<br>
To me had spoken, and my will declar'd,<br>
As Beatrice will'd, explicitly.<br>
Nor with oracular response obscure,<br>
Such, as or ere the Lamb of God was slain,<br>
Beguil'd the credulous nations; but, in terms<br>
Precise and unambiguous lore, replied<br>
The spirit of paternal love, enshrin'd,<br>
Yet in his smile apparent; and thus spake:<br>
"Contingency, unfolded not to view<br>
Upon the tablet of your mortal mold,<br>
Is all depictur'd in the' eternal sight;<br>
But hence deriveth not necessity,<br>
More then the tall ship, hurried down the flood,<br>
Doth from the vision, that reflects the scene.<br>
From thence, as to the ear sweet harmony<br>
From organ comes, so comes before mine eye<br>
The time prepar'd for thee. &nbsp;Such as driv'n out<br>
From Athens, by his cruel stepdame's wiles,<br>
Hippolytus departed, such must thou<br>
Depart from Florence. &nbsp;This they wish, and this<br>
Contrive, and will ere long effectuate, there,<br>
Where gainful merchandize is made of Christ,<br>
Throughout the livelong day. &nbsp;The common cry,<br>
Will, as 't is ever wont, affix the blame<br>
Unto the party injur'd: but the truth<br>
Shall, in the vengeance it dispenseth, find<br>
A faithful witness. &nbsp;Thou shall leave each thing<br>
Belov'd most dearly: this is the first shaft<br>
Shot from the bow of exile. &nbsp;Thou shalt prove<br>
How salt the savour is of other's bread,<br>
How hard the passage to descend and climb<br>
By other's stairs, But that shall gall thee most<br>
Will be the worthless and vile company,<br>
With whom thou must be thrown into these straits.<br>
For all ungrateful, impious all and mad,<br>
Shall turn 'gainst thee: but in a little while<br>
Theirs and not thine shall be the crimson'd brow<br>
Their course shall so evince their brutishness<br>
T' have ta'en thy stand apart shall well become thee.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First refuge thou must find, first place of rest,<br>
In the great Lombard's courtesy, who bears<br>
Upon the ladder perch'd the sacred bird.<br>
He shall behold thee with such kind regard,<br>
That 'twixt ye two, the contrary to that<br>
Which falls 'twixt other men, the granting shall<br>
Forerun the asking. &nbsp;With him shalt thou see<br>
That mortal, who was at his birth impress<br>
So strongly from this star, that of his deeds<br>
The nations shall take note. &nbsp;His unripe age<br>
Yet holds him from observance; for these wheels<br>
Only nine years have compass him about.<br>
But, ere the Gascon practice on great Harry,<br>
Sparkles of virtue shall shoot forth in him,<br>
In equal scorn of labours and of gold.<br>
His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely,<br>
As not to let the tongues e'en of his foes<br>
Be idle in its praise. &nbsp;Look thou to him<br>
And his beneficence: for he shall cause<br>
Reversal of their lot to many people,<br>
Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes.<br>
And thou shalt bear this written in thy soul<br>
Of him, but tell it not;" and things he told<br>
Incredible to those who witness them;<br>
Then added: "So interpret thou, my son,<br>
What hath been told thee.&mdash;Lo! the ambushment<br>
That a few circling seasons hide for thee!<br>
Yet envy not thy neighbours: time extends<br>
Thy span beyond their treason's chastisement."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, as the saintly spirit, by his silence,<br>
Had shown the web, which I had streteh'd for him<br>
Upon the warp, was woven, I began,<br>
As one, who in perplexity desires<br>
Counsel of other, wise, benign and friendly:<br>
"My father! well I mark how time spurs on<br>
Toward me, ready to inflict the blow,<br>
Which falls most heavily on him, who most<br>
Abandoned himself. &nbsp;Therefore 't is good<br>
I should forecast, that driven from the place<br>
Most dear to me, I may not lose myself<br>
All others by my song. &nbsp;Down through the world<br>
Of infinite mourning, and along the mount<br>
From whose fair height my lady's eyes did lift me,<br>
And after through this heav'n from light to light,<br>
Have I learnt that, which if I tell again,<br>
It may with many woefully disrelish;<br>
And, if I am a timid friend to truth,<br>
I fear my life may perish among those,<br>
To whom these days shall be of ancient date."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brightness, where enclos'd the treasure smil'd,<br>
Which I had found there, first shone glisteningly,<br>
Like to a golden mirror in the sun;<br>
Next answer'd: "Conscience, dimm'd or by its own<br>
Or other's shame, will feel thy saying sharp.<br>
Thou, notwithstanding, all deceit remov'd,<br>
See the whole vision be made manifest.<br>
And let them wince who have their withers wrung.<br>
What though, when tasted first, thy voice shall prove<br>
Unwelcome, on digestion it will turn<br>
To vital nourishment. &nbsp;The cry thou raisest,<br>
Shall, as the wind doth, smite the proudest summits;<br>
Which is of honour no light argument,<br>
For this there only have been shown to thee,<br>
Throughout these orbs, the mountain, and the deep,<br>
Spirits, whom fame hath note of. &nbsp;For the mind<br>
Of him, who hears, is loth to acquiesce<br>
And fix its faith, unless the instance brought<br>
Be palpable, and proof apparent urge."</p>

<p>
<br>
CANTO XVIII</p>

<p>Now in his word, sole, ruminating, joy'd<br>
That blessed spirit; and I fed on mine,<br>
Tempting the sweet with bitter: she meanwhile,<br>
Who led me unto God, admonish'd: "Muse<br>
On other thoughts: bethink thee, that near Him<br>
I dwell, who recompenseth every wrong."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sweet sounds of comfort straight I turn'd;<br>
And, in the saintly eyes what love was seen,<br>
I leave in silence here: nor through distrust<br>
Of my words only, but that to such bliss<br>
The mind remounts not without aid. &nbsp;Thus much<br>
Yet may I speak; that, as I gaz'd on her,<br>
Affection found no room for other wish.<br>
While the everlasting pleasure, that did full<br>
On Beatrice shine, with second view<br>
From her fair countenance my gladden'd soul<br>
Contented; vanquishing me with a beam<br>
Of her soft smile, she spake: "Turn thee, and list.<br>
These eyes are not thy only Paradise."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As here we sometimes in the looks may see<br>
Th' affection mark'd, when that its sway hath ta'en<br>
The spirit wholly; thus the hallow'd light,<br>
To whom I turn'd, flashing, bewray'd its will<br>
To talk yet further with me, and began:<br>
"On this fifth lodgment of the tree, whose life<br>
Is from its top, whose fruit is ever fair<br>
And leaf unwith'ring, blessed spirits abide,<br>
That were below, ere they arriv'd in heav'n,<br>
So mighty in renown, as every muse<br>
Might grace her triumph with them. &nbsp;On the horns<br>
Look therefore of the cross: he, whom I name,<br>
Shall there enact, as doth in summer cloud<br>
Its nimble fire." &nbsp;Along the cross I saw,<br>
At the repeated name of Joshua,<br>
A splendour gliding; nor, the word was said,<br>
Ere it was done: then, at the naming saw<br>
Of the great Maccabee, another move<br>
With whirling speed; and gladness was the scourge<br>
Unto that top. &nbsp;The next for Charlemagne<br>
And for the peer Orlando, two my gaze<br>
Pursued, intently, as the eye pursues<br>
A falcon flying. &nbsp;Last, along the cross,<br>
William, and Renard, and Duke Godfrey drew<br>
My ken, and Robert Guiscard. &nbsp;And the soul,<br>
Who spake with me among the other lights<br>
Did move away, and mix; and with the choir<br>
Of heav'nly songsters prov'd his tuneful skill.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Beatrice on my right l bent,<br>
Looking for intimation or by word<br>
Or act, what next behoov'd: and did descry<br>
Such mere effulgence in her eyes, such joy,<br>
It past all former wont. &nbsp;And, as by sense<br>
Of new delight, the man, who perseveres<br>
In good deeds doth perceive from day to day<br>
His virtue growing; I e'en thus perceiv'd<br>
Of my ascent, together with the heav'n<br>
The circuit widen'd, noting the increase<br>
Of beauty in that wonder. &nbsp;Like the change<br>
In a brief moment on some maiden's cheek,<br>
Which from its fairness doth discharge the weight<br>
Of pudency, that stain'd it; such in her,<br>
And to mine eyes so sudden was the change,<br>
Through silvery whiteness of that temperate star,<br>
Whose sixth orb now enfolded us. &nbsp;I saw,<br>
Within that Jovial cresset, the clear sparks<br>
Of love, that reign'd there, fashion to my view<br>
Our language. &nbsp;And as birds, from river banks<br>
Arisen, now in round, now lengthen'd troop,<br>
Array them in their flight, greeting, as seems,<br>
Their new-found pastures; so, within the lights,<br>
The saintly creatures flying, sang, and made<br>
Now D. now I. now L. figur'd I' th' air.<br>

First, singing, to their notes they mov'd, then one<br>
Becoming of these signs, a little while<br>
Did rest them, and were mute. &nbsp;O nymph divine<br>
Of Pegasean race! whose souls, which thou<br>
Inspir'st, mak'st glorious and long-liv'd, as they<br>
Cities and realms by thee! thou with thyself<br>
Inform me; that I may set forth the shapes,<br>
As fancy doth present them. &nbsp;Be thy power<br>
Display'd in this brief song. &nbsp;The characters,<br>
Vocal and consonant, were five-fold seven.<br>
In order each, as they appear'd, I mark'd.<br>
Diligite Justitiam, the first,<br>
Both verb and noun all blazon'd; and the extreme<br>
Qui judicatis terram. &nbsp;In the M.<br>
Of the fifth word they held their station,<br>
Making the star seem silver streak'd with gold.<br>
And on the summit of the M. I saw<br>
Descending other lights, that rested there,<br>
Singing, methinks, their bliss and primal good.<br>
Then, as at shaking of a lighted brand,<br>
Sparkles innumerable on all sides<br>
Rise scatter'd, source of augury to th' unwise;<br>
Thus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence<br>
Seem'd reascending, and a higher pitch<br>
Some mounting, and some less; e'en as the sun,<br>
Which kindleth them, decreed. &nbsp;And when each one<br>
Had settled in his place, the head and neck<br>
Then saw I of an eagle, lively<br>
Grav'd in that streaky fire. &nbsp;Who painteth there,<br>
Hath none to guide him; of himself he guides;<br>
And every line and texture of the nest<br>
Doth own from him the virtue, fashions it.<br>
The other bright beatitude, that seem'd<br>
Erewhile, with lilied crowning, well content<br>
To over-canopy the M. mov'd forth,<br>
Following gently the impress of the bird.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet star! what glorious and thick-studded gems<br>
Declar'd to me our justice on the earth<br>
To be the effluence of that heav'n, which thou,<br>
Thyself a costly jewel, dost inlay!<br>
Therefore I pray the Sovran Mind, from whom<br>
Thy motion and thy virtue are begun,<br>
That he would look from whence the fog doth rise,<br>
To vitiate thy beam: so that once more<br>
He may put forth his hand 'gainst such, as drive<br>
Their traffic in that sanctuary, whose walls<br>
With miracles and martyrdoms were built.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye host of heaven! whose glory I survey l<br>
O beg ye grace for those, that are on earth<br>
All after ill example gone astray.<br>
War once had for its instrument the sword:<br>
But now 't is made, taking the bread away<br>
Which the good Father locks from none. &nbsp;&mdash;And thou,<br>
That writes but to cancel, think, that they,<br>
Who for the vineyard, which thou wastest, died,<br>
Peter and Paul live yet, and mark thy doings.<br>
Thou hast good cause to cry, "My heart so cleaves<br>
To him, that liv'd in solitude remote,<br>
And from the wilds was dragg'd to martyrdom,<br>
I wist not of the fisherman nor Paul."</p>

<p>Before my sight appear'd, with open wings,<br>
The beauteous image, in fruition sweet<br>
Gladdening the thronged spirits. &nbsp;Each did seem<br>
A little ruby, whereon so intense<br>
The sun-beam glow'd that to mine eyes it came<br>
In clear refraction. &nbsp;And that, which next<br>
Befalls me to portray, voice hath not utter'd,<br>
Nor hath ink written, nor in fantasy<br>
Was e'er conceiv'd. &nbsp;For I beheld and heard<br>
The beak discourse; and, what intention form'd<br>
Of many, singly as of one express,<br>
Beginning: "For that I was just and piteous,<br>
l am exalted to this height of glory,<br>
The which no wish exceeds: and there on earth<br>
Have I my memory left, e'en by the bad<br>
Commended, while they leave its course untrod."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus is one heat from many embers felt,<br>
As in that image many were the loves,<br>
And one the voice, that issued from them all.<br>
Whence I address them: "O perennial flowers<br>
Of gladness everlasting! that exhale<br>
In single breath your odours manifold!<br>
Breathe now; and let the hunger be appeas'd,<br>
That with great craving long hath held my soul,<br>
Finding no food on earth. &nbsp;This well I know,<br>
That if there be in heav'n a realm, that shows<br>
In faithful mirror the celestial Justice,<br>
Yours without veil reflects it. &nbsp;Ye discern<br>
The heed, wherewith I do prepare myself<br>
To hearken; ye the doubt that urges me<br>
With such inveterate craving." &nbsp;Straight I saw,<br>
Like to a falcon issuing from the hood,<br>
That rears his head, and claps him with his wings,<br>
His beauty and his eagerness bewraying.<br>
So saw I move that stately sign, with praise<br>
Of grace divine inwoven and high song<br>
Of inexpressive joy. &nbsp;"He," it began,<br>
"Who turn'd his compass on the world's extreme,<br>
And in that space so variously hath wrought,<br>
Both openly, and in secret, in such wise<br>
Could not through all the universe display<br>
Impression of his glory, that the Word<br>
Of his omniscience should not still remain<br>
In infinite excess. &nbsp;In proof whereof,<br>
He first through pride supplanted, who was sum<br>
Of each created being, waited not<br>
For light celestial, and abortive fell.<br>
Whence needs each lesser nature is but scant<br>
Receptacle unto that Good, which knows<br>
No limit, measur'd by itself alone.<br>
Therefore your sight, of th' omnipresent Mind<br>
A single beam, its origin must own<br>
Surpassing far its utmost potency.<br>
The ken, your world is gifted with, descends<br>
In th' everlasting Justice as low down,<br>
As eye doth in the sea; which though it mark<br>
The bottom from the shore, in the wide main<br>
Discerns it not; and ne'ertheless it is,<br>
But hidden through its deepness. &nbsp;Light is none,<br>
Save that which cometh from the pure serene<br>
Of ne'er disturbed ether: for the rest,<br>
'Tis darkness all, or shadow of the flesh,<br>
Or else its poison. &nbsp;Here confess reveal'd<br>
That covert, which hath hidden from thy search<br>
The living justice, of the which thou mad'st<br>
Such frequent question; for thou saidst&mdash;'A man<br>
Is born on Indus' banks, and none is there<br>
Who speaks of Christ, nor who doth read nor write,<br>
And all his inclinations and his acts,<br>
As far as human reason sees, are good,<br>
And he offendeth not in word or deed.<br>
But unbaptiz'd he dies, and void of faith.<br>
Where is the justice that condemns him? &nbsp;where<br>
His blame, if he believeth not?'&mdash;What then,<br>
And who art thou, that on the stool wouldst sit<br>
To judge at distance of a thousand miles<br>
With the short-sighted vision of a span?<br>
To him, who subtilizes thus with me,<br>
There would assuredly be room for doubt<br>
Even to wonder, did not the safe word<br>
Of scripture hold supreme authority.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O animals of clay! &nbsp;O spirits gross I<br>
The primal will, that in itself is good,<br>
Hath from itself, the chief Good, ne'er been mov'd.<br>
Justice consists in consonance with it,<br>
Derivable by no created good,<br>
Whose very cause depends upon its beam."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on her nest the stork, that turns about<br>
Unto her young, whom lately she hath fed,<br>
While they with upward eyes do look on her;<br>
So lifted I my gaze; and bending so<br>
The ever-blessed image wav'd its wings,<br>
Lab'ring with such deep counsel. &nbsp;Wheeling round<br>
It warbled, and did say: "As are my notes<br>
To thee, who understand'st them not, such is<br>
Th' eternal judgment unto mortal ken."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then still abiding in that ensign rang'd,<br>
Wherewith the Romans over-awed the world,<br>
Those burning splendours of the Holy Spirit<br>
Took up the strain; and thus it spake again:<br>
"None ever hath ascended to this realm,<br>
Who hath not a believer been in Christ,<br>
Either before or after the blest limbs<br>
Were nail'd upon the wood. &nbsp;But lo! of those<br>
Who call 'Christ, Christ,' there shall be many found,<br>
&nbsp;In judgment, further off from him by far,<br>
Than such, to whom his name was never known.<br>
Christians like these the Ethiop shall condemn:<br>
When that the two assemblages shall part;<br>
One rich eternally, the other poor.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What may the Persians say unto your kings,<br>
When they shall see that volume, in the which<br>
All their dispraise is written, spread to view?<br>
There amidst Albert's works shall that be read,<br>
Which will give speedy motion to the pen,<br>
When Prague shall mourn her desolated realm.<br>
There shall be read the woe, that he doth work<br>
With his adulterate money on the Seine,<br>
Who by the tusk will perish: there be read<br>
The thirsting pride, that maketh fool alike<br>
The English and Scot, impatient of their bound.<br>
There shall be seen the Spaniard's luxury,<br>
The delicate living there of the Bohemian,<br>
Who still to worth has been a willing stranger.<br>
The halter of Jerusalem shall see<br>
A unit for his virtue, for his vices<br>
No less a mark than million. &nbsp;He, who guards<br>
The isle of fire by old Anchises honour'd<br>
Shall find his avarice there and cowardice;<br>
And better to denote his littleness,<br>
The writing must be letters maim'd, that speak<br>
Much in a narrow space. &nbsp;All there shall know<br>
His uncle and his brother's filthy doings,<br>
Who so renown'd a nation and two crowns<br>
Have bastardized. &nbsp;And they, of Portugal<br>
And Norway, there shall be expos'd with him<br>
Of Ratza, who hath counterfeited ill<br>
The coin of Venice. &nbsp;O blest Hungary!<br>
If thou no longer patiently abid'st<br>
Thy ill-entreating! and, O blest Navarre!<br>
If with thy mountainous girdle thou wouldst arm thee<br>
In earnest of that day, e'en now are heard<br>
Wailings and groans in Famagosta's streets<br>
And Nicosia's, grudging at their beast,<br>
Who keepeth even footing with the rest."</p>

<p>When, disappearing, from our hemisphere,<br>
The world's enlightener vanishes, and day<br>
On all sides wasteth, suddenly the sky,<br>
Erewhile irradiate only with his beam,<br>
Is yet again unfolded, putting forth<br>
Innumerable lights wherein one shines.<br>
Of such vicissitude in heaven I thought,<br>
As the great sign, that marshaleth the world<br>
And the world's leaders, in the blessed beak<br>
Was silent; for that all those living lights,<br>
Waxing in splendour, burst forth into songs,<br>
Such as from memory glide and fall away.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet love! that dost apparel thee in smiles,<br>
How lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles,<br>
Which merely are from holy thoughts inspir'd!<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the precious and bright beaming stones,<br>
That did ingem the sixth light, ceas'd the chiming<br>
Of their angelic bells; methought I heard<br>
The murmuring of a river, that doth fall<br>
From rock to rock transpicuous, making known<br>
The richness of his spring-head: and as sound<br>
Of cistern, at the fret-board, or of pipe,<br>
Is, at the wind-hole, modulate and tun'd;<br>
Thus up the neck, as it were hollow, rose<br>
That murmuring of the eagle, and forthwith<br>
Voice there assum'd, and thence along the beak<br>
Issued in form of words, such as my heart<br>
Did look for, on whose tables I inscrib'd them.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The part in me, that sees, and bears the sun,,<br>
In mortal eagles," it began, "must now<br>
Be noted steadfastly: for of the fires,<br>
That figure me, those, glittering in mine eye,<br>
Are chief of all the greatest. &nbsp;This, that shines<br>
Midmost for pupil, was the same, who sang<br>
The Holy Spirit's song, and bare about<br>
The ark from town to town; now doth he know<br>
The merit of his soul-impassion'd strains<br>
By their well-fitted guerdon. &nbsp;Of the five,<br>
That make the circle of the vision, he<br>
Who to the beak is nearest, comforted<br>
The widow for her son: now doth he know<br>
How dear he costeth not to follow Christ,<br>
Both from experience of this pleasant life,<br>
And of its opposite. &nbsp;He next, who follows<br>
In the circumference, for the over arch,<br>
By true repenting slack'd the pace of death:<br>
Now knoweth he, that the degrees of heav'n<br>
Alter not, when through pious prayer below<br>
Today's is made tomorrow's destiny.<br>
The other following, with the laws and me,<br>
To yield the shepherd room, pass'd o'er to Greece,<br>
From good intent producing evil fruit:<br>
Now knoweth he, how all the ill, deriv'd<br>
From his well doing, doth not helm him aught,<br>
Though it have brought destruction on the world.<br>
That, which thou seest in the under bow,<br>
Was William, whom that land bewails, which weeps<br>
For Charles and Frederick living: now he knows<br>
How well is lov'd in heav'n the righteous king,<br>
Which he betokens by his radiant seeming.<br>
Who in the erring world beneath would deem,<br>
That Trojan Ripheus in this round was set<br>
Fifth of the saintly splendours? &nbsp;now he knows<br>
Enough of that, which the world cannot see,<br>
The grace divine, albeit e'en his sight<br>
Reach not its utmost depth." &nbsp;Like to the lark,<br>
That warbling in the air expatiates long,<br>
Then, trilling out his last sweet melody,<br>
Drops satiate with the sweetness; such appear'd<br>
That image stampt by the' everlasting pleasure,<br>
Which fashions like itself all lovely things.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, though my doubting were as manifest,<br>
As is through glass the hue that mantles it,<br>
In silence waited not: for to my lips<br>
"What things are these?" &nbsp;involuntary rush'd,<br>
And forc'd a passage out: whereat I mark'd<br>
A sudden lightening and new revelry.<br>
The eye was kindled: and the blessed sign<br>
No more to keep me wond'ring and suspense,<br>
Replied: "I see that thou believ'st these things,<br>
Because I tell them, but discern'st not how;<br>
So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith:<br>
As one who knows the name of thing by rote,<br>
But is a stranger to its properties,<br>
Till other's tongue reveal them. &nbsp;Fervent love<br>
And lively hope with violence assail<br>
The kingdom of the heavens, and overcome<br>
The will of the Most high; not in such sort<br>
As man prevails o'er man; but conquers it,<br>
Because 't is willing to be conquer'd, still,<br>
Though conquer'd, by its mercy conquering.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those, in the eye who live the first and fifth,<br>
Cause thee to marvel, in that thou behold'st<br>
The region of the angels deck'd with them.<br>
They quitted not their bodies, as thou deem'st,<br>
Gentiles but Christians, in firm rooted faith,<br>
This of the feet in future to be pierc'd,<br>
That of feet nail'd already to the cross.<br>
One from the barrier of the dark abyss,<br>
Where never any with good will returns,<br>
Came back unto his bones. &nbsp;Of lively hope<br>
Such was the meed; of lively hope, that wing'd<br>
The prayers sent up to God for his release,<br>
And put power into them to bend his will.<br>
The glorious Spirit, of whom I speak to thee,<br>
A little while returning to the flesh,<br>
Believ'd in him, who had the means to help,<br>
And, in believing, nourish'd such a flame<br>
Of holy love, that at the second death<br>
He was made sharer in our gamesome mirth.<br>
The other, through the riches of that grace,<br>
Which from so deep a fountain doth distil,<br>
As never eye created saw its rising,<br>
Plac'd all his love below on just and right:<br>
Wherefore of grace God op'd in him the eye<br>
To the redemption of mankind to come;<br>
Wherein believing, he endur'd no more<br>
The filth of paganism, and for their ways<br>
Rebuk'd the stubborn nations. &nbsp;The three nymphs,<br>
Whom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing,<br>
Were sponsors for him more than thousand years<br>
Before baptizing. &nbsp;O how far remov'd,<br>
Predestination! is thy root from such<br>
As see not the First cause entire: and ye,<br>
O mortal men! be wary how ye judge:<br>
For we, who see our Maker, know not yet<br>
The number of the chosen: and esteem<br>
Such scantiness of knowledge our delight:<br>
For all our good is in that primal good<br>
Concentrate, and God's will and ours are one."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, by that form divine, was giv'n to me<br>
Sweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight,<br>
And, as one handling skillfully the harp,<br>
Attendant on some skilful songster's voice<br>
Bids the chords vibrate, and therein the song<br>
Acquires more pleasure; so, the whilst it spake,<br>
It doth remember me, that I beheld<br>
The pair of blessed luminaries move.<br>
Like the accordant twinkling of two eyes,<br>
Their beamy circlets, dancing to the sounds.</p>

<p>Again mine eyes were fix'd on Beatrice,<br>
And with mine eyes my soul, that in her looks<br>
Found all contentment. &nbsp;Yet no smile she wore<br>
And, "Did I smile," quoth she, "thou wouldst be straight<br>

For, mounting these eternal palace-stairs,<br>

Whoso can deem, how fondly I had fed<br>
My sight upon her blissful countenance,<br>
May know, when to new thoughts I chang'd, what joy<br>
To do the bidding of my heav'nly guide:<br>
In equal balance poising either weight.<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the crystal, which records the name,<br>
(As its remoter circle girds the world)<br>

A ladder, which my ken pursued in vain,<br>
So lofty was the summit; down whose steps<br>
I saw the splendours in such multitude<br>
Descending, ev'ry light in heav'n, methought,<br>
Was shed thence. &nbsp;As the rooks, at dawn of day<br>
Bestirring them to dry their feathers chill,<br>
Some speed their way a-field, and homeward some,<br>
Returning, cross their flight, while some abide<br>
And wheel around their airy lodge; so seem'd<br>
That glitterance, wafted on alternate wing,<br>
As upon certain stair it met, and clash'd<br>
Its shining. And one ling'ring near us, wax'd<br>
So bright, that in my thought: said: "The love,<br>
Which this betokens me, admits no doubt."<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwillingly from question I refrain,<br>
To her, by whom my silence and my speech<br>
Are order'd, looking for a sign: whence she,<br>
Who in the sight of Him, that seeth all,<br>
Saw wherefore I was silent, prompted me<br>
T' indulge the fervent wish; and I began:<br>
"I am not worthy, of my own desert,<br>
That thou shouldst answer me; but for her sake,<br>
Who hath vouchsaf'd my asking, spirit blest!<br>
That in thy joy art shrouded! say the cause,<br>
Which bringeth thee so near: and wherefore, say,<br>
Doth the sweet symphony of Paradise<br>
Keep silence here, pervading with such sounds<br>
Of rapt devotion ev'ry lower sphere?"<br>
"Mortal art thou in hearing as in sight;"<br>
Was the reply: "and what forbade the smile<br>
Of Beatrice interrupts our song.<br>
Only to yield thee gladness of my voice,<br>
And of the light that vests me, I thus far<br>
Descend these hallow'd steps: not that more love<br>
Invites me; for lo! there aloft, as much<br>
Or more of love is witness'd in those flames:<br>
But such my lot by charity assign'd,<br>
That makes us ready servants, as thou seest,<br>
To execute the counsel of the Highest.<br>
"That in this court," said I, "O sacred lamp!<br>
Love no compulsion needs, but follows free<br>
Th' eternal Providence, I well discern:<br>
This harder find to deem, why of thy peers<br>
Thou only to this office wert foredoom'd."<br>
I had not ended, when, like rapid mill,<br>
Upon its centre whirl'd the light; and then<br>
The love, that did inhabit there, replied:<br>
"Splendour eternal, piercing through these folds,<br>
Its virtue to my vision knits, and thus<br>
Supported, lifts me so above myself,<br>
That on the sov'ran essence, which it wells from,<br>
I have the power to gaze: and hence the joy,<br>
Wherewith I sparkle, equaling with my blaze<br>
The keenness of my sight. &nbsp;But not the soul,<br>
That is in heav'n most lustrous, nor the seraph<br>
That hath his eyes most fix'd on God, shall solve<br>
What thou hast ask'd: for in th' abyss it lies<br>
Of th' everlasting statute sunk so low,<br>
That no created ken may fathom it.<br>
And, to the mortal world when thou return'st,<br>
Be this reported; that none henceforth dare<br>
Direct his footsteps to so dread a bourn.<br>
The mind, that here is radiant, on the earth<br>
Is wrapt in mist. &nbsp;Look then if she may do,<br>
Below, what passeth her ability,<br>
When she is ta'en to heav'n." &nbsp;By words like these<br>
Admonish'd, I the question urg'd no more;<br>
And of the spirit humbly sued alone<br>
T' instruct me of its state. &nbsp;"'Twixt either shore<br>
Of Italy, nor distant from thy land,<br>
A stony ridge ariseth, in such sort,<br>
The thunder doth not lift his voice so high,<br>
They call it Catria: at whose foot a cell<br>
Is sacred to the lonely Eremite,<br>
For worship set apart and holy rites."<br>
A third time thus it spake; then added: "There<br>
So firmly to God's service I adher'd,<br>
That with no costlier viands than the juice<br>
Of olives, easily I pass'd the heats<br>
Of summer and the winter frosts, content<br>
In heav'n-ward musings. &nbsp;Rich were the returns<br>
And fertile, which that cloister once was us'd<br>
To render to these heavens: now 't is fall'n<br>
Into a waste so empty, that ere long<br>
Detection must lay bare its vanity<br>
Pietro Damiano there was I yclept:<br>
Pietro the sinner, when before I dwelt<br>
Beside the Adriatic, in the house<br>
Of our blest Lady. &nbsp;Near upon my close<br>
Of mortal life, through much importuning<br>
I was constrain'd to wear the hat that still<br>
From bad to worse it shifted.&mdash;Cephas came;<br>
He came, who was the Holy Spirit's vessel,<br>
Barefoot and lean, eating their bread, as chanc'd,<br>
At the first table. &nbsp;Modern Shepherd's need<br>
Those who on either hand may prop and lead them,<br>
So burly are they grown: and from behind<br>
Others to hoist them. &nbsp;Down the palfrey's sides<br>
Spread their broad mantles, so as both the beasts<br>
Are cover'd with one skin. &nbsp;O patience! thou<br>
That lookst on this and doth endure so long."<br>
I at those accents saw the splendours down<br>
From step to step alight, and wheel, and wax,<br>
Each circuiting, more beautiful. &nbsp;Round this<br>
They came, and stay'd them; uttered them a shout<br>
So loud, it hath no likeness here: nor I<br>
Wist what it spake, so deaf'ning was the thunder."</p>
